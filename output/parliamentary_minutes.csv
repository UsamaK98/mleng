15:12,The Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic,Kate Forbes,"On Thursday 13 June, I made a statement in the chamber on the Scottish Government’s current position with regard to European structural and investment funds. That statement addressed the inaccurate reports in the media, and I made it clear that I would make a further statement once both the programmes—the European social fund and the European regional development fund—had formally closed.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,The Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic,Kate Forbes,"I did not expect the next statement to be quite so soon; at that point, I was clear that it was unlikely to be before the second half of 2025. As I said less than a fortnight ago, I would confirm the final outturn figures and outcomes achieved at that point. Until then, estimates of the use of the funding allocations, the final eligible expenditure and the reimbursements from the European Commission are all speculative.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,The Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic,Kate Forbes,"Opposition parties have requested another statement less than a fortnight after my first statement. In the intervening time, nothing has changed, there has been no new information and further reports in the press have not changed the original points that I made. However, I am never one to shy away from stating the facts once again, so I thank the Presiding Officer for the opportunity to repeat and confirm all the points that I made a fortnight ago.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,The Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic,Kate Forbes,"As I explained in my statement less than a fortnight ago, the system for administering and paying out European structural funds is retrospective. Allocations of potential funding are notified to member states at the start of each seven-year programme. Projects are then set up by partner organisations and they incur costs. Those costs are incurred initially and entirely by the organisations themselves. For example, in the third sector, that might be a charity. In the public sector, that might be local government or NatureScot. Those costs are then claimed back from the Scottish Government at our risk. Once we have paid the costs that our partners have incurred, we focus on submitting reimbursement claims to the European Commission, which reimburses us only after all the evidence has been checked and verified.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,The Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic,Kate Forbes,"Furthermore, the funds cannot be used for core public services, so they cannot be used—as some have suggested—to mitigate the impact of austerity on our national health service, on local government or on core infrastructure. The funds are not a replacement for public sector funding.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,The Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic,Kate Forbes,The projects that are under discussion all completed their delivery by December 2023. We are currently continuing to check and to pay out on our partners’ final claims for the costs of delivering those projects. We will submit substantial reimbursement claims to the European Commission in July—next month—and a final one will be submitted in October this year. Those will include reimbursement claims for all structural fund projects delivered by partners and for eligible funding towards the costs of accommodation and support services for Ukrainian migrants to Scotland. The date of the final reimbursement payments from the European Commission to us will not be until 2025.,2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,The Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic,Kate Forbes,"As I said in my statement on 13 June, and as is detailed in the Scottish Parliament information centre’s briefing, our original allocation of potential funding at the start of the programme was marginally reduced by the European Commission because some of our partners did not meet their annual spending targets. Let me be crystal clear about why that was.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,The Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic,Kate Forbes,"Some partners had overestimated the costs that they would incur and the pace at which they would incur them, others were unable to meet the very strict criteria for projects and some partners struggled to prove eligibility for all their costs. For all those reasons, some potential funding was foregone—as a European Commission official pointed out as a statement of fact back in 2019. Changes to funding allocations have happened in other parts of the United Kingdom and, indeed, across Europe over the past 40 years of the programmes.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,The Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic,Kate Forbes,"However, no money was handed back. It is simply the case that the ceiling of total funding allocations to Scotland was lowered. That did not impact on the delivery of any projects that were under way or on the ability of any partners to extend projects or to claim funding back from the Scottish Government. Those points are important, because the contrary has been claimed publicly.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,The Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic,Kate Forbes,"As I said previously, Scottish Government officials repeatedly encourage our partners, including via the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, to spend their allocations, to put forward any new projects or to expand existing ones to maximise the use of the funds. However, as I explained before, many projects and types of spending are simply not eligible. European structural funds cannot be used for anything whose funding could or should be met from regular domestic budgets; it must be additional.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,The Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic,Kate Forbes,"In previous years, Scotland was involved in each of the funding cycles, which meant that projects that did not secure funding in one cycle—perhaps because of timescale constraints—could always consider the subsequent cycle. The difference here is that the cycle that is under consideration is the final cycle. There is a definitive end point entirely, because we are no longer in the European Union and are not benefiting from the current cycle of funding that is being distributed. That is not a decision that the Scottish people supported by a majority. In fact, we are in that situation entirely because the current UK Government removed Scotland from the European Union and, by extension, from eligibility for the next cycle.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,The Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic,Kate Forbes,"Although all parties are entitled to scrutinise the decisions that the Government takes—questions on which I look forward to answering—there is a great irony in the fact that the current situation has become of interest only because Scottish projects will not benefit from any future funding cycles of European structural funds. That decision is formally supported by the Labour Party and the Conservative Party, which have both stated publicly that they do not support a return to the European Union for Scotland.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,The Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic,Kate Forbes,"A full and up-to-date list of Scotland’s European structural fund projects and the partners that delivered them is available on the Scottish Government website. Members can see the huge range of projects and programmes that have been supported through European funding. Many local authorities have provided debt management, fuel poverty, housing and education advice programmes in their areas, such as Perth and Kinross Council’s positive futures project, which have been part funded by the European social fund.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,The Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic,Kate Forbes,"The supporting new Scots in Stirling project provided a holistic service, including money management, benefits advice, social inclusion activities and courses in English for speakers of other languages to the growing number of refugees who are settling in the Stirling Council area. That ESF-supported project offered eligible participants access to specialist money support and training, often from the very first day of their arrival in Stirling.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,The Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic,Kate Forbes,"On a bigger scale, employability pipeline projects that were delivered by councils across Scotland supported people with multiple barriers to give them a better chance of securing employment. The youth employment initiative in the west of Scotland helped young people aged 16 to 24 years old to access the labour market. That support also came through the European social fund.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,The Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic,Kate Forbes,"The European regional development fund has supported the Medical Device Manufacturing Centre to the tune of £1.6 million. The MDMC project is made up of a team of engineers, scientists and clinicians from four universities, who provide medical device developers with advice, access to manufacturing facilities, engineering and technical expertise, and regulatory advice, which is for companies that are seeking to translate device concepts into commercial products. The team has a comprehensive suite of manufacturing equipment that is installed in dedicated labs at Heriot-Watt University, which ranges from laser-based manufacturing equipment to medical device packaging and environmental testing equipment.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,The Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic,Kate Forbes,"ERDF funding also contributed £10.6 million to connecting communities across the Highlands and Islands. The Scottish Government’s £21 million 4G infill programme is improving Scotland’s rural mobile phone coverage in selected not-spots—areas where no commercial coverage has been rolled out. Without intervention, those rural areas would miss out on improved connectivity and the benefits that that brings to home life, working life and the wider local economy. Thanks to ERDF support, police, ambulance and mountain rescue emergency services can provide a rapid response to local and national crises, with better resilience offered as a result of improved communication between people in control rooms and those who are out in the field.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,The Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic,Kate Forbes,"For local communities, improved 4G coverage potentially makes their areas more attractive to tourists and offers social benefits, such as improved access to services and the ability to keep in touch during Covid-19. It certainly makes my life a lot easier when I am working as I travel across the Highlands and Islands.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,The Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic,Kate Forbes,"All those projects are testament to the immense benefits that European funding has delivered over the years. They represent just a snapshot of the benefits that European structural funds have brought to Scotland’s businesses and communities. Those projects are all from the current programming period, which will, sadly, be our last as we enter the lengthy process to formally bring them to a close.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,The Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic,Kate Forbes,"As I said less than a fortnight ago, every pound or euro that can be claimed back will be claimed back. I will report on that when the final position is confirmed. I hope that my next statement will not be in another two weeks.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,The Deputy Presiding Officer,,"The Deputy First Minister will now take questions on the issues that were raised in her statement. I intend to allow about 20 minutes for questions, after which we will move to the next item of business.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Liz Smith,Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con,I thank the Deputy First Minister for prior sight of her statement.,2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Liz Smith,Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con,"I made the request for a second statement because of the total lack of clarity on the part of the Scottish Government in explaining the facts about what has happened to large sums of EU taxpayers’ money. Today’s statement still leaves questions unanswered, so I seek complete clarity on the following issues.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Liz Smith,Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con,"First, the minutes of a meeting on 14 November 2019 that was chaired by the Scottish Government and attended by representatives of lead partners and European Commission officials show that the Scottish Government advised the meeting that the managing authority—the Scottish Government—was",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Liz Smith,Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con,"“In practice, no payments were affected.”",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Liz Smith,Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con,"Secondly, for complete clarity once and for all, exactly how much EU money has been left on the table unspent because the relevant deadlines for claims have passed?",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Liz Smith,Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con,"Thirdly, how many times did the structures between the Scottish Government and local authorities for distributing the funds in Scotland change between 2014 and December 2023 in order to address audit failings?",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Kate Forbes,,"I thank the member for her clear questions, which I will go through one by one, because they are quite simple to answer.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Kate Forbes,,"On the first question, in relation to the minutes that she quotes, I say directly to her that at no point did the Scottish Government pause the payment to our partners of the funding that they had incurred. She is right to quote directly from the minutes, but I say unequivocally that the Scottish Government paid out the funding at our own risk. We recognised the costs that had been incurred, and the Scottish Government ensured that we paid out the funds to the partners. There was no, as it were, lost opportunity from our partners’ perspective when they incurred the costs.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Kate Forbes,,"Secondly, the member asked a very direct question about EU funding. Presiding Officer, I realise that, like the last time I did this, my answers might be lengthy, but it is a complex issue and I want to be clear. On EU funding, I can give the member these figures in euros. The current allocation that we have in terms of the upper ceiling is €783.4 million. The current amount committed to projects to date is €647 million. Two elements will determine how much higher that figure is. The first is that we are currently going through meeting the July deadline and then the October deadline for securing reimbursement. The second is the funding that we will be able to reclaim for settling Ukrainian migrants.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Kate Forbes,,"I am not in a position to give the member that figure right now, because the deadlines are still ahead of us. We intend to claim back every penny that we can. The final deadline is late 2025, and I will be delighted to return to the chamber in 2025 with an update on the outturn figures. Until that point, all that I can give is a snapshot in advance of the deadline.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Kate Forbes,,"Thirdly, the structure has remained pretty much the same over the past 40 years in relation to reimbursement to the Scottish Government and the Scottish Government being responsible for reclaiming from the European Commission.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Kate Forbes,,"Thank you for the additional time, Presiding Officer. I hope that that is clear.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Michael Marra,North East Scotland) (Lab,"I begin by pointing out that, in 2019, zero pounds was handed to partners by the Scottish Government. That fact was provided to me in an answer to a parliamentary question that I received just this week. Any further clarity on that in writing would be appreciated.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Michael Marra,North East Scotland) (Lab,I take issue with the Deputy First Minister saying:,2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Michael Marra,North East Scotland) (Lab,“no money was handed back. It is simply the case that the ceiling of total funding allocations to Scotland was lowered.”,2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Michael Marra,North East Scotland) (Lab,"On 4 June, the Deputy First Minister said in the chamber:",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Michael Marra,North East Scotland) (Lab,"“There has been no conclusion to the scheme. It will continue, and we will endeavour to spend as much of it as possible.”—[Official Report, 4 June 2024; c 3.]",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Michael Marra,North East Scotland) (Lab,"As a result of that December deadline, the Deputy First Minister’s officials must now have a number. They will seek to maximise the reclaims, but what is the exposure of the Scottish Government right now? What is that figure, which must have been set in December?",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Kate Forbes,,"I will endeavour to answer those questions as well. I will start with the minutes that were quoted in relation to the engagement with European Commission officials. That speaks to the fact that we have engaged extensively and frequently with European Commission officials. The fact that that was five years ago speaks to constant monitoring of the situation. We also received an extension, which we were encouraged to use—and which we are using—to claim back the funding. I have already set out the deadlines of July and October, which is an extension. We do not expect to be an outlier in any way compared with previous schemes or compared with the rest of the UK.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Kate Forbes,,"On the point that the member distinguishes about 2019, we absolutely did pay out to partners in 2019. That relates to Liz Smith’s question. I appreciate that it is complex, and this answer is not intended to be patronising, but there are two elements. There is the money that the Scottish Government reclaims from the European Commission and there is the money that our partners get. From our partners’ perspective, they know that they have incurred costs, and they just want those costs to be covered. Their costs were covered; at no point did partners not receive the funds that they needed to cover their costs. Those were covered by the Scottish Government at our risk, and I have made that clear.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Kate Forbes,,"The second element is what we reclaimed from the European Commission. It has been well documented that there was a suspension in 2019 from the European Commission to the Scottish Government. We worked with the European Commission and that was resolved, but from our partners’ perspective—from a charities perspective and a local government perspective—there was never any pause. There was no lost opportunity in that regard. If more information is required, I am happy to deliver it.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Kate Forbes,,"On what the member perceives to be a distinction between what was said earlier and what was said today, there is no distinction. I have said clearly that we are engaged in a reimbursement process right now and we will not know the final outturn figures until 2025. I have given the figures that we are privy to now, but we will not know the final figures until 2025. I do not intend to mislead Parliament by giving figures that are only a snapshot in time, when we need to reclaim the full reimbursement and the funding to cover the resettling of Ukrainian migrants.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,The Deputy Presiding Officer,,"A number of members are seeking to ask questions. I appreciate the complexity of the subject, but perhaps we could have a wee bit of brevity.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Kenneth Gibson,Cunninghame North) (SNP,"I welcome the cabinet secretary’s statement. How do the EU structural and investment expenditure funds that have already been spent or will be spent by the end of this financial tranche compare with the resources that will be allocated by the UK Government once that resource is no longer available? Does the cabinet secretary agree that the Tory position on the matter is astonishing given its complete inability to deliver levelling-up funds that were allegedly committed years ago, including £23.7 million for my constituency?",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Kate Forbes,,"It will not surprise the member to hear that there has been no comparable replacement funding from the UK Government. The closest that we have is the shared prosperity fund, but if we compare EU funding with the UK Government’s replacement funding, we can see that the new regime is short term, that decision making is opaque and that we do not have the same level of autonomy that we used to enjoy when we were in the European Union.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Kate Forbes,,I imagine that we all represent communities and constituents who know the benefit of the funding that came from the European Union and are extremely exercised to know that they cannot apply for that same EU funding and frustrated by the complete lack of transparency about how to apply for comparable funding such as the shared prosperity fund.,2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Murdo Fraser,Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con,"I will go back to the second question that my colleague Liz Smith asked, in response to which the Deputy First Minister quoted two figures: the sum that was allocated by the EU, which was €783.4 million, and the sum that was committed, which was €647 million. That leaves a balance of €136 million not committed by the end of the 2023 deadline, which has now passed. Can any of that €136 million now be recovered?",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Kate Forbes,,"With respect, that is precisely why, when Michael Marra and others ask me to give figures, they struggle to appreciate the distinction between giving a snapshot in time—where we stand right now—and where we expect to be when the outturn figures are published in 2025.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Kate Forbes,,"My point is that we expect the reimbursement process to take place during the next few months. It is an on-going discussion with the European Commission. I am not able to predict precisely where we will land in October, because it is a two-way discussion. Layered on top of that, we have the on-going discussions about reimbursement for Ukrainian refugees.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Kate Forbes,,"We are engaged in that programme and the projects that were concluded by December 2023 are what I cited in my statement, but I look forward to coming back in 2025 and being able to give final figures.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Michelle Thomson,Falkirk East) (SNP,"There is much chest beating and there are claims of lost money here, yet the position remains the same. The replacement UK structural fund first round, granted by the UK Government, was £212 million over three years to Scotland. If we were still in the EU, Scotland would have got £549 million over three years. Surely that is a shortfall of £337 million that was lost as a result of Tory Brexit madness and Labour-handmaiden-enabled Brexit madness.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Kate Forbes,,"I have already given my comments on the shared prosperity fund, which is opaque to constituents, centralised and difficult to engage with. In sharp contrast, the seven-year structural fund and, before that, the cohesion programmes enabled truly long-term and valuable projects to be delivered.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Kate Forbes,,"I repeat a point that I made in my statement: previously, being part of each cycle as it developed meant that an organisation that missed out on one cycle always knew that there was another cycle to come, which meant that it was not constrained by the timescales that we are currently constrained by. It meant that, in one sense, money could be carried over into future cycles—it was not expressly like that, but that was certainly the experience of our partners. The difference here is that there is a definitive end point and we intend to claim back every penny that can be claimed.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,The Deputy Presiding Officer,,"I call Paul Sweeney, who is joining us remotely.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Paul Sweeney,Glasgow) (Lab,"Two weeks ago, when I asked about the Citizens Theatre redevelopment project, which has a capital funding gap of between £7 million and £15 million, the cabinet secretary told me that the Citizens Theatre project would need to meet strict criteria set out by the European Commission in order to be able to access vital funding to ensure that the project does not collapse. That is despite the fact that £11.7 million of Government and council capital grant funding has already been committed and sunk into the project.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Paul Sweeney,Glasgow) (Lab,"It seems to me that the cabinet secretary is now suggesting that the remaining European structural funds are not available to the overrunning Citizens Theatre project, despite it being the sort of cultural heritage project that would typically be funded by European structural funds. Is this not now simply an example of Government mismanagement that has squandered available funding that could have been used to reinforce that critical project in Glasgow?",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Kate Forbes,,"No. The point that I made in my previous answer was that the criteria that are set by the European Commission are extremely strict and quite rigid. That is one of the reasons why not many organisations are eligible to claim back that funding, and that has been the feedback from some of our partners as well.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Kate Forbes,,We are keen to engage with Paul Sweeney on the substantive issue of the Citizens Theatre and to ensure that we support the project to be as successful as possible. I know that conversations are on-going with the relevant minister in that regard.,2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,John Mason,Glasgow Shettleston) (SNP,"To follow on from Michelle Thomson’s question, the Deputy First Minister said in her statement that, in previous years, Scotland was involved in each of the funding cycles, which meant that projects that did not secure funding in one cycle could always consider the subsequent cycle. Is the effect of all this that, if we had still been in the EU, we could still be looking at continuing funding but, because we have been forced out of the EU, we have in effect had to jump off a moving bus and that is why we have hit this hard deadline?",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Kate Forbes,,"That is right. When I addressed Parliament earlier this month, I stated that Scotland stands to lose access to significant funding that was theoretically replaced by EU structural funds. However, the member is right to talk about the cycles. At the end of every funding period, any leftover funding would usually count towards the next funding period. Because of Brexit, there are no future funds and that means that Scotland will lose out on significant funding of euros that could be received by projects across the country.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Patrick Harvie,Glasgow) (Green,"I share the frustration at those members who are happy that we are out of the European Union but pretend to be sad that we have lost European funding. However, I am still unclear about some of the DFM’s answers in response to media reports. Has she seen the report claiming that a paper was presented to the Scottish Government’s programme monitoring committee in June 2019 that referred to",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Kate Forbes,,"I have seen the report that Patrick Harvie refers to. I have briefly answered some of the comments about the fact that the Scottish Government took on board the points that were relayed to it by the European Commission. The important point to make is that our partners did not see a loss of funding. In 2019, the European Commission suspended its reimbursement payments for both the ESF and the ERDF programmes due to changes and improvements that needed to be made in the management and control of the programmes that had been identified by auditors in 2016-17. A wholesale improvement programme was put in place in order to ensure that there was absolute compliance with the regulations. The reimbursements restarted in 2020 and 2022 respectively. Importantly, that did not interrupt the payments of partners’ claims by the Scottish Government. All parts of the UK and many other member states have gone through a similar scenario during which their programmes have been suspended at one time or another in order to allow for improvements to be made.",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Ben Macpherson,Edinburgh Northern and Leith) (SNP,"It is my understanding that the allocation of the EU structural and investment funding is done on a multi-annual basis. I am conscious that the funding period that was referred to in the statement has included a Brexit referendum, subsequent negotiations and a worldwide pandemic. Therefore, does the Deputy First Minister think that we need to be mindful of the particular context that was faced during that funding period and how that impacted partners and their projects?",2024-06-26,scottish_parliament_report_26_06_24.txt
15:12,Kate Forbes,,"The member is right. I was finance secretary during Covid and we know the impact that that had on many of the initiatives and projects across the country.

One would hope that the UK Government would provide a lead, but the new Government has tied its hands in relation to national insurance, VAT and income tax. One thing that worries me about that context is that the UK Government might well use highly inefficient taxes to plug budget gaps, rather than using the broad-based taxes.

Since the global financial crisis, spending reviews have come along rather erratically for short periods of time. We cannot plan capital expenditure year to year; capital planning for public resources must be done substantially ahead of time. We also need to ensure that the private sector has the capacity to bid for contracts and execute them.

09:45,Professor Bell,,"I guess that some of it comes from the institutional framework that exists to try to help people into work. It was some time ago, but I remember when youth unemployment was a problem in the UK and I was working on comparisons with Germany. I recall one of our German colleagues arguing that in Germany, where the apprenticeship system is far better developed than the one in the UK, helping people through the transition from education into work was seen as a societal responsibility. We just do not have that culture.

09:45,Professor Heald,,"Can I intervene and go back to your original question? What matters in relation to the budget is what the Scottish Fiscal Commission thinks about behavioural effects. On the question of the increase in the top rate, the Fiscal Commission thinks that 85 per cent of the revenue disappears. In the context of the advanced rate, it thinks that 50 per cent of the revenue disappears. There will be arguments for many years about whether those numbers are correct, but given how budget scoring works, the position in practice for the Parliament and the Government is that those are the numbers that count.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt

09:45,Professor Heald,,"We now live in a world economy that is much more mobile; it is very mobile at corporate level.

For high-middle earners, the interaction of the tax system with child benefit withdrawal creates incentives for part-time working. The movement of people to part-time working, not through personal preference but because of the incentives in the tax and benefits systems, is not conducive to the economic growth that is fundamental to achieving all four of the First Minister’s objectives.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt

In respect of how that factors in through the fiscal framework into the budget, it is treated in the same way as it is anywhere else in the UK; it is just divided up as a proportion of the amount. That will cause a problem if the divergence becomes so wide that the HMRC thinks that there is a specific different risk to Scotland—that people are more likely to evade tax in Scotland than people elsewhere in the UK are. That is not currently the case. It could be the case in the future, depending on how the situations might diverge.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt

That was also driven by the fact that, as you know, the UK Government has announced similar measures on pay deals. If the UK Government decides to fund some, part, or all of those deals through increased taxation or increased borrowing, that will result in an increase to the Scottish budget through an increase in Barnett consequentials. In effect, there will be more spending and more money will be available, so the Scottish Government will get its additional money.

Some of those relate to multiyear spending plans, which have already been mentioned. If the UK Government had a more regular spending plan in place, that would make it easier for the Scottish Government to plan in the medium term. That is slightly different from some of the recommendations about medium-term strategies, which are more about assessing what the Scottish Government would do in different scenarios. The idea of that is to allow the Scottish Government to have a more planned reaction, as opposed to a reaction that is based on what the UK Government might do in any given year.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt

The scenarios might be broader; there may well be more or less tax than we thought or spending might be more volatile than we thought. Ever since the inception of the fiscal framework, volatility and uncertainty have been a cornerstone. With great power comes great responsibility; the Scottish Government should be able to manage the uncertainty as best as it possibly can through medium-term strategies, but, undoubtedly, it is difficult.

I make it clear in my submission that I am not against super-parity policies, such as the Scottish child payment and free prescription charges, but the point is that there is a big number attached to super-parity policies and a negligible number attached to sub-parity policies. The problem is that expenditure on public services in areas such as health, education and housing gets squeezed simply because Parliament operates under a fairly fixed budget. Therefore, it is very important that Parliament understands what the costs of all the super-parity policies are. As I said, the super-parity policies are very easy to find, but the sub-parity policies are not.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt

Again, it comes back to what we said in those reports that you mentioned and in our submission. Understanding the flex of your budget—the elements that are fixed, the elements that can be changed but it will take time, and the elements that can be flexed quickly—is really important, as well as mapping that against scenarios of what the next year and the next three or five years could look like.

That is much bigger than the defence budget—it is about the same size as the education budget in the UK as a whole now. That was partly caused by a monetary policy response to the rate of inflation that followed the pandemic, which in turn has propagated very large wage demands. The public sector was somewhat behind, and now we are in a catch-up period. Although that is stretching the budget quite markedly, those demands were potentially predictable, given that public sector wages had fallen behind those in the private sector in recent years.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt

Based on what we have seen, if there is no increase in productivity, the NHS will need 3 to 4 per cent more people each year. That does not seem sustainable at the moment. Therefore, productivity in the NHS has to be looked at. If the NHS is going to attract more people, it will have to pay them higher wages than they are currently paid.

The big issue seems to be that the pension credit income limits are actually quite low, so people fall out of being able to claim benefits at a point at which most of us would probably think that they still needed payments. If you are going to do such things, you need very careful planning of the administrative processes and eligibility. It is hoped that the UK Government and devolved Governments will realise that, even if you want to reduce some of these benefits, you have to approach it in a systematic and careful way.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt
10:15,Michael Marra,,"We took some very good evidence in Dundee recently from young people about their priorities for the Scottish budget. Their top priority was employment opportunities and careers.

10:15,Professor Heald,,"I do not know of the data, but my experience as a university professor in Scotland was always that there was very substantial migration of our students south, so that is certainly an issue. The structure of the economy is probably more of an issue than tax itself, but getting people to come to and stay in Scotland is an important public priority.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt
10:15,Professor Bell,,"I have not looked at that issue recently. I imagine that it will soon be possible to interpret what is going on on the basis of the census on both sides of the border. Net migration flows tend to be from the rest of the UK into Scotland, so there will always be some people coming and going. I suspect that the average age of the people who are coming to Scotland is higher than that of those who are leaving. That is an empirical question for which I have only some heuristic evidence. That is the case in the Highlands, without a shadow of a doubt. However, it must be said that we have not been all that good at creating employment opportunities. Anton Muscatelli recently made the point that all of Scotland’s cities must step up to the mark, because those are probably the places where most jobs are going to be generated.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt

10:15,Professor Bell,,That is extremely difficult in remote rural areas. That goes back to my earlier point that you probably need the public sector to take slightly bigger risks and induce the private sector to invest in those areas.,2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt

10:15,Michelle Thomson,Falkirk East) (SNP,"Many of the areas that I am interested in have been covered. I want to explore the main theme of this evidence session. Thus far, the evidence has highlighted the considerable complexity that is illustrated by the fiscal framework. It also points to the fact that there is a bit of a johari window issue in that politicians are driven to look at very nearside issues in relation to the budget in hand at this moment in time, although our earlier conversation was about the lack of long-term infrastructure investment—capex and so on. Public sector net investment was 8 per cent of gross domestic product in the 1960s and had dropped to 0.5 per cent of GDP by the 1990s. That big thematic framing of the UK macroeconomy tends to be forgotten when we are looking at this exercise.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt

It seems to me that you should not waste a crisis, and the current situation is an opportunity to put in place a more coherent strategic view. I am interested in looking at international comparators on the issue. Yesterday, I heard an interesting discussion on, dare I say it, the “Leading” podcast about Taiwan and how public services and trust in Government have been transformed, basically through digital infrastructure.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt
10:15,Professor Bell,,"On strategic issues, I have to say that I am concerned about whether the fiscal framework has longevity. I cannot imagine that it has all that much public support, because so few of the public have a clear understanding of how on earth it works. Another issue is that we have talked and talked about prevention, yet we have not really grasped that nettle. Surely now is the time to do that.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt
10:15,Professor Heald,,"I do not think that we can make much progress without better relations between the Scottish Government and the UK Government. There are all sorts of issues. When the UK Government makes changes in-year, those are perfectly feasible for the UK Government, but they have much bigger ramifications for the Scottish Government because of its limited fiscal flexibility. Equally, the Scottish Government needs a better relationship with local authorities. In the evidence that has been submitted to the committee for this inquiry, there are several local authority submissions, and they all make the point that so much ring fencing is going on, which deprives local authorities of flexibility.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt
10:15,Professor Heald,,"I think that one needs better relationships between the UK Government and the Scottish Government, and between the Scottish Government and local authorities. The Scottish Government tends to treat local authorities as agents of itself, in a way that certainly happens in England as well. There needs to be better governance of those complex relationships, as well as a better understanding.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt
10:15,Professor Heald,,"To go back to what David Bell said a minute ago, the revised fiscal framework does not give the Scottish Government enough flexibility. We are going through a period of a remarkable level of shocks. I hope that the shocks are over, but I am not very confident that they are over. In a period of shocks, it is very difficult to balance, year on year, a budget of the size of the Scottish Government’s. The more the Scottish Government takes on demand-led expenditure, such as some social security benefits, the more the problem becomes intensified.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt
10:15,Professor Heald,,"There is an issue to be negotiated between the UK and Scottish Governments and between the Scottish Government and local authorities. The council tax freeze clearly came as a big shock to local authorities and has caused a great deal of ill will. The UK Government tends to think that, if something goes wrong, we need more centralisation. The Scottish Government seems to think exactly the same: that we need more centralisation. My view is that, generally, excessive centralisation is one of the problems at both the UK and Scottish levels.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt

10:30,Richard Robinson,,"The previous medium-term strategy was quite stark. There is a gap. It would help if the budget and the medium-term financial strategy could give us a clearer understanding of what will make the difference and get us over the line. If it is reform, it would be good to know how much fiscal sustainability the Scottish Government expects to see from reform, and in what timeframe, because it will not all happen immediately. If it is prioritisation, we need to clearly see which elements of spending or costs will be protected, because that is what makes the biggest difference. We would also like to see an honest conversation about the areas where the Scottish Government is prepared to disinvest, if needs be, during the year in order to manage its fiscal balance.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt

I was at the Health and Social Care Committee last week discussing integration joint boards, which add a layer of complexity, because you are trying to marry local democratically elected bodies with NHS boards. It is unclear whether that is going to be successful.

10:30,The Convener,,"My first question is for Professor Heald. This is not specifically about reform but it follows up what you said. In your answers and responses today, you have been really good at putting a lot of what is in your document on to the record. I appreciate that. We have not really talked an awful lot today about the issue of improving public services. Your submission says:",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt

10:30,Professor Heald,,We have to go back and think about the fiscal framework in the context of the Scottish Parliament taking on more expenditure functions that are not plannable. I have already made the point that having fiscal flexibility from borrowing powers and a resource back-up is insufficient. There must be very careful thought about that.,2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt
10:30,Professor Heald,,"There has been a theme of strategic thinking about expenditure, which I greatly welcome, but that will be ineffective if you have to have panic reductions in expenditure in-year. Once organisations know that the finance minister might come along and take back any money that is left in their budgets halfway through the financial year, you will find that organisations lower down the hierarchy start behaving differently.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt
10:30,Professor Heald,,"I understand that we have gone through a period of repeated shocks. As has been made clear, some of the public sector wage settlements are catch-up, which ought to have been expected. Unless we get a period of stability—which I have doubts about—we will continue with the same problems. There is an issue with the Scottish Government talking to a UK Government early in its life about how one can manage certain pressures, some of which are completely outside the Scottish Government’s control, without disrupting forward planning.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt

10:30,Professor Bell,,"There are not huge numbers of highly paid managers in the public sector. One difficulty associated with focusing on those at the bottom is pay compression, in that differentials get squeezed, and you may therefore find that people’s willingness to take on additional responsibility or training is weakened. That is one possibility. There is another highly relevant question, about whether there are sufficient high-level skills in the public sector—managerial skills, leadership skills or even technical skills—to carry through the kinds of reforms that we have been talking about and just to make organisations function efficiently.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt

10:30,Vikki Manson,Federation of Small Businesses,"I feel as though those who are running the consultations are at arm’s length from small businesses. We have responded to quite a number of consultations on topics such as the circular economy and heat in buildings. There is a bit of a disconnect between small businesses and Government when consultations are held. It is usually organisations such as ours that would respond to them, but it is difficult to engage with small businesses to understand their opinions on the content of consultations. We try to reach out to understand their views and we hold round-table sessions, but small businesses suffer hugely from lack of time, so it is difficult to get them engaged. There are concerns that there have been a lot of paperwork, consultations and strategies without engaging with small businesses and understanding their views.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt

My head of policy at the FSB has been involved with the new deal for business regulatory sub-group. Over the past few weeks, some progress has been made on that, and there has been a commitment to analyse the deeper and cumulative impact of regulations on small businesses through a more detailed business and regulatory impact assessment.

10:30,David Lonsdale,Scottish Retail Consortium,"In addition to our written submission, we have sent committee members a paper that we published on our Scottish budget recommendations. It outlines a number of regulatory initiatives that the Scottish Government is pursuing at present. Of course, we must also be cognisant of the fact that the new UK Government has quite a rich regulatory agenda, much of which we heard about in the King’s speech a few weeks ago. That is a lot to take on at a time when trading conditions for the sector are pretty tough. At the moment, we publish our retail sales and shopper footfall data every month. The most recent figures, which cover the past 12 months, show that retail sales in Scotland fell by 0.3 per cent.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt
10:30,David Lonsdale,Scottish Retail Consortium,"We were encouraged by the programme for government that was issued the other day. From what we have seen and digested thus far, it seems that no new additional regulatory initiatives are emerging, which is good. There was a recognition not only of the things that we have been saying to ministers and the Government but of the wider context of trading conditions and what is happening at the UK Government level. That said, there were no fewer initiatives coming forward, so the wide range of matters that we have articulated in our budget submission and to the committee are still on the table.

10:30,David Lonsdale,Scottish Retail Consortium,"On your earlier question, we feel that consultation is important even if we do not necessarily see eye to eye with the Scottish Government on a specific issue. The paper that the Government published two years ago on introducing in-store restrictions on alcohol marketing is seared in my memory. There was no consultation; it just published a paper that said, “This is what we are going to do,” and there were no real discussions beforehand. Consultation is helpful and, I hope, leads to there being a more rounded and considered viewpoint on a given issue.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt

10:30,David Lonsdale,,"Absolutely. Another topical example is last December’s budget, when the Scottish Government announced that it was considering a business rate surtax on grocery stores. That came as a total shock to us—it came completely out of the blue. It completely flew in the face of the shared ambition that had been set out in the new deal for business, which was about involving business at the earliest stages of policy development.

We do not have too much of an issue with that, as we see it as being similar to the plastic bag charge. Again, it is more about how that will be delivered, what systems will need to be put in place, what financial support there will be for small businesses, the using up of existing stock and other such issues. All such things need to be teased out a little more, and businesses need to be allowed enough time at the other end to put them in place, rather than rushing things through in order to tick a box to say that it has been done.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt
10:30,Vikki Manson,,"There are also concerns about heat in buildings. Zero direct emissions heating systems are a concern for our small businesses. Again, it is about delivery: businesses need to be given enough time to put in place those new systems. How businesses will finance that is also a concern. We looked at research on replacing current gas and electric boilers. No finance was available for that. Loans were available, but a lot of small businesses cannot stretch to taking on more debt, so there is a need to look at grants and other creative ways in order to support them for the roll-out of new regulations.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt

The survey looked at about 10 different areas for small businesses, and we had quite a lot of responses. One of the areas that we looked at in detail was the administration of small businesses. The data showed that most small businesses spend at least eight hours a week on admin tasks over and above their normal daily operational duties. They are overloaded, and they have to create time for anything additional that comes in. That hampers growth.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt

11:00,David Lott,Universities Scotland,"We consider that research can make a contribution across all the Government’s priorities but, if we were to choose one main priority to focus on, it would be economic growth. Our research base in Scotland is exceptional. It levers in almost £1 billion from outwith Scottish Government sources, which creates remarkable assets for Scotland. It is always worth remembering that research, in and of itself, is a significant economic actor. A lot of people—well over 10,000—are employed in high-quality research jobs, and sustaining that is dependent on leveraging that resource.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt
11:00,David Lott,Universities Scotland,"The other key point about research is its output, which contributes across Government priorities. It is the foundation from which we see company creation and innovation in our economy—recently, you visited Dundee and saw that for yourselves. A team in the University of Dundee’s school of life sciences will be sustained not only by Scottish Government resources, through the Scottish Funding Council, but, crucially, by leveraging money from other sources across the UK and internationally. The programme for government includes an example of work between the University of Dundee, AstraZeneca and the Scottish Government on kidney treatment.

11:00,The Convener,,"One of the things that John Mason pointed out when we had a similar discussion a couple of years ago was that, at that time, the University of Glasgow had reserves of £770 million. Facts such as that make things difficult from our perspective. I can understand exactly what you are saying but, when some universities have that level of cash assets, it is difficult for us to say that we should take money out of other areas of priority expenditure, which we would have to do, given that the Scottish Government has a more or less fixed budget from which to provide funding. How would you respond to that? I know that not all universities are as prosperous as that, and perhaps Glasgow does not have quite as much money stashed away now as it did a couple of years ago, but how would Universities Scotland address that issue?",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt

Audit Scotland acknowledges that reserves are an important part of an institution’s financial strategy, but it is important to remember that the reserves represent the accumulated value of the institution, so that figure will include buildings and equipment, which means that you can end up looking at a rather skewed picture. An ancient institution such as the University of Glasgow has a lot of assets, but they are not assets that can be easily turned into spend on staffing, equipment, heating and so on. What one certainly should look at is the underlying operating position, and the Scottish Funding Council's examination of the institutions’ forecasts for 2023-24 shows a deficit of £75 million at a sector level.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt
11:00,David Lott,,"Rightly, the SFC would like to see institutions returning a surplus of between 3 per cent and 5 per cent, so the current situation is going in the wrong direction. One of the big reasons it is going in the wrong direction is that, although we have always had some cross-subsidy for research, we are also combining that with significant cross-subsidy for education and we are now very much reliant on income from international fees for that cross-subsidy, which has very much dried up in the recent past.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt

We think that that is not suited to SME-heavy economies such as Scotland’s, because it is quite a challenge for a company to engage with a funding call from Innovate UK, and there are a lot of opportunity costs rolled into making such projects happen. If the universities can take the lead on behalf of business partners, we may be able to leverage more Innovate UK money into Scotland. We currently leverage about 6 per cent of the UK total, as far as we are aware. Although it has dropped significantly, we are leveraging 12 or 13 per cent of research councils’ money, because that is about universities.

The University of Glasgow’s reserves come to £1 billion but it does not have £1 billion in cash; its reserves are not liquid and a lot of it is in the form of properties. The University of Edinburgh has reserves of about £2.7 billion, which is the largest of any university. A billion pounds of that is cash, although £1.7 billion is largely the university’s property portfolio. Where a public institution has such substantial cash reserves—more than the Scottish Government has been allowed to have in its reserves, historically—do you acknowledge the challenge in providing even more public funding to that institution?",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt

11:00,David Lott,,"First, you probably have an advantage over me in knowing the detail of the University of Edinburgh’s accounts, but I would observe in general that, when we look at the cash figure, we need to be aware of where that has come from and what it is attributed to, and we also need to look at the debt figure. Sometimes, the figures can be very large, because some of the organisations are very big, but we need to look at the detail before reaching the conclusion that an institution is in a particular position.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt
11:00,David Lott,,"I will make two points. One is that the institutions are delivering activity on behalf of Scotland by, for example, teaching people and carrying out research, but the resources that are being made available for that currently means that they are making a loss, and that is a significant issue. If an institution has cash, that enables it to invest and act to the benefit of Scotland. If we divert resource—that is behind what you are suggesting—to make up for the deficit that I am describing, that would remove that potential impact. We need to think very carefully before starting to explore whether, at this moment, an institution may be able to make a contribution to the cost of something.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt

11:00,Ross Greer,,"David Lonsdale, your initial point of complaint about the public health levy was, essentially, that the retail sector felt blindsided by it being included in the budget.

I think that it surprises quite a lot of people when they find out that the additional amount that is paid as a result of MUP does not go back to the public sector or the health service but is retained by the retailers. Given that we are talking about health-harming products that have not only a significant impact on people’s lives—that should be the focus today—but a really significant cost to the health service, is it not only fair to have a consequential levy or surcharge, or however it is phrased? That is particularly the case given that, at the moment, with MUP not being in place in the rest of the UK, retailers in Scotland pocket an additional £30 million a year as a result of MUP that they would not get otherwise?

11:15,David Lonsdale,,"Okay. To reel that back slightly, there are a few assumptions out there about an increase in MUP generating additional profits for retailers. I think that those assumptions are misplaced. We talked about Governments consulting business in advance. Normally, when the Government publishes a proposal, it has a BRIA that accompanies that, and the Government tends to involve and consult business in advance to inform the development of that.

Another factor to bear in mind in any discussion of where profits are going is that, in all likelihood, there will be some sort of customer reaction. If prices go up at the end of this month, we could see customers deciding to switch from supermarket own brands to existing branded products with a similar price, which they will presumably see as being better quality but which generate less profit for retailers.

We are seeing investment in England specifically in the research environment, but we are seeing much more limited investment in Scotland.

Through the use of the term “ring fencing”, we have seen such an approach being passed on to councils, yet it is not being applied to the Government itself. Ross gave the example of minimum unit pricing. There has also been a suggestion that the £640 million of ScotWind moneys would just go on building supply-side infrastructure and so on for renewables. This is a bit of a throwaway question, but what are your thoughts on the principle of hypothecated taxes? Would that intrigue you, given that this session is about strategic budgets? David Lonsdale is going first on that one.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt
11:45,David Lonsdale,,"Thank you for that one. We are open to suggestions. When there are no specific suggestions, it is difficult to understand the pros and cons of certain approaches and whether they would work in good or bad economic times.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt
11:45,David Lonsdale,,"I will pick one example. A number of years ago, the UK Government brought in the apprenticeship levy, which, in theory, is hypothecated to spending on apprenticeships, as the name suggests. However, that is not the case if you are in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. As I understand it, the revenues that are collected across the UK go into the Treasury. In England, employers who are liable for the levy can claim most of it back for spending on apprenticeships. However, the way that things work in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is that the money goes into the Treasury and then comes back through the Barnett formula. Like the other devolved Governments, the Scottish Government would have spent a given amount beforehand, it was taken away from it, in a sense, and then the apprenticeship levy came in. Therefore we have a tax whereby retail employers in Scotland, and other employers who are subject to it, do not get the money back to then spend on apprenticeships. Therefore the levy is, in effect, an employment tax.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt
11:45,David Lonsdale,,"I have deliberately cited an example that is not particularly great and does not inspire much confidence. A different one is that, in the previous iteration of the public health supplement, which was in play a dozen years ago, the money just went into the general kitty. Therefore, to be honest, I am slightly sceptical about the notion. However, if sensible proposals were to emerge, we would consider them in the round. Ideally, they would not affect retailers or customers.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt

11:45,Vikki Manson,,"I reiterate what David Lonsdale said about ring fencing. For us, one of the most recent examples is the visitor levy. I know that it is still undergoing analysis, but the expectation of small businesses was that the money would come back into the community and be used for services. We are currently going through a consultation on single-use cups. I know that the intention is to give some of the charges that will be applied to those back to small businesses for operational costs. The question is whether that money will be ring fenced or will simply be lost in the abyss.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt
11:45,Michelle Thomson,,"You have touched on the subtle point that I was making, which is less rigid than the one on hypothecated taxes. It is about following the funding of such measures.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt
11:45,David Lott,,"I will echo the point about the apprenticeship levy. As happens with many hypothecated taxes, we can look at the levy and think that it is a good approach because employers will want to train people. Our members’ experience, though, is that employers want to engage graduate apprentices, but the way to resource that is not clear. As was mentioned earlier, such apprenticeships have been rolled into the overall funding system without any extra money being provided. The issue is about implementation, is it not? If such resource was readily available through that route, perhaps one would perceive the levy as a hypothecated tax that is working well. However, at the moment there is no such clarity for employers and organisations that provide training.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt

11:45,Jamie Halcro Johnston,Highlands and Islands) (Con,"Good afternoon. I have a couple of questions. The first, for David Lonsdale and Vikki Manson, follows up some of the questions that have already been asked. Both of your organisations welcome the recent statement’s focus on economic growth. However, funding for enterprise bodies has been cut over the past few budgets; visitor levies have just been discussed; DRS introduced huge costs to the sectors but was dropped; and there has been the licensing of short-term lets. Regulatory burdens go up. There is also a differential between the rest of UK and Scotland in rates relief. I look for an honest answer: although you may welcome a refocus on economic growth, how confident are you that it will be delivered?",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt

11:45,Vikki Manson,,"That is a really difficult question. We were encouraged by some things in last week’s programme for government. For us, the main thing is to see concrete action. When the First Minister came in, in May, he spoke about reducing strategies and consultations and having concrete work done that would make a difference. That is probably the key: to have those commitments brought forward so that we can see how they will impact on small businesses. As things are, the next year will be challenging. There is no doubt about that. Will that burden fall on small businesses again? Will they have to make further reductions, and cut their cloth again to try to see things through for another year?",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt

11:45,David Lonsdale,,"I have walked you through several of the areas in which we have some concerns, and on which there needs to be further action to deliver on the objectives. Growing the economy—bringing in higher revenues for the public services, alleviating poverty and all the rest of it—is a shared objective. However, we need to get the economy moving, and that requires action on the regulatory front and on some of the taxes that we outlined in our budget submission.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt
11:45,Jamie Halcro Johnston,,"David Lott, you talked about the cross-subsidy for research, in particular. I have a very simple question. Is there a concern that, if there is a squeeze on some of the funding for research, universities’ focus may well be on the return on investment—on the areas that attract the largest grants—and that some research that might have social good will be deprioritised?",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt
11:45,David Lott,,"It is worth stating that our research effort as a whole requires cross-subsidy, albeit that some elements are closer to breaking even or may generate a surplus. I fear that we will just do less, and I cannot break down where that loss will reside. By having fewer and smaller research teams, we will not generate what is a very direct economic impact.",2024-09-10,scottish_parliament_report_10_09_24.txt

You say that £10 million would be a small sum of money, but that would probably have a much bigger impact for small businesses than it would for larger organisations.

11:30,Ross Greer,,"I am struggling to decide whether there is a challenge for the Government because it cannot evidence the work that it is doing, or whether the situation is actually worse than that and the NPF is simply not being taken into account.

11:30,Kate Forbes,,"I will answer that in a couple of ways, and then the officials might want to come in. I can speak to how we embed the framework in policy work, but I think that you are talking about the visible measurement and reporting to Parliament of the work that we do. A key part of the review process has been consideration of what we can do on reporting. For example, the chief statistician has been heavily involved in the review and in considering how he can support the work through working with the Office for National Statistics and looking at wellbeing measures and so on, so that we are able to quantify the position. I can give you lots of qualitative evidence on what we do, but I think that you are looking for us to quantify the work and show what has changed that would not have changed if we had not embedded the national performance framework.",2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt

11:30,Ross Greer,,"Last week or a couple of weeks ago, we had a witness who rhymed off the last half dozen of the Government’s major strategy documents across a range of portfolios. I will leave the PFG aside for the moment and come back to it. If I am getting this right, I think that four of the six documents made no reference to the national performance framework, and the other two made passing reference, but there was nothing specific about individual outcomes. Do you recognise the challenge there? How has it come about that the Government, which is, as you say, committed to the national performance framework, is consistently publishing high-level, significant documents to outline its strategy, but those documents do not reference the NPF? That is a problem, is it not?",2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt
11:45,Kate Forbes,,"We will definitely take that on board. Again, that goes back to visibility and to the point that I made to the convener at the beginning about confusing visibility for practice.

11:45,Kate Forbes,,"This is a key part of our implementation plan for the framework. Once we are all agreed and once we have received the committee’s report and feedback on whether the substance is right, the next hurdle is implementation and embedding the framework. As part of that, we need to consider better reporting and accountability. I am open to discussions about how we embed greater levels of accountability in the process. If it is as simple as every strategy having to illustrate how it aligns with the national performance framework, we could consider that, or whether there are other ways of doing it.",2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt

It is safe to say that you will find the national performance framework mentioned across Government-published strategy, but the point that is coming through is that that is not consistent across all of it, as the DFM just said. I know that the committee will be talking about the implementation plan in a minute, but we can definitely look at the issue as we look to implement the framework better next year, to make sure that the NPF is as consistent as it should be across all Government-published policy and strategy.

You argued that the inclusion is implicit rather than explicit, and you seemed to indicate that that was a deliberate choice.

The Government does not expect the NPF to be used only by the Government directly and public bodies more widely. The Government expects everybody—the whole of society and the whole economy, including business and so on—to embrace the national performance framework, so the Government itself should visibly embrace it. Otherwise, it is hard to see how the leadership role is being performed.",2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt

Alternatively, is it just a question of saying, “Houses are good, roads are good—so whatever”?",2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt
11:45,Kate Forbes,,"The national performance framework is designed to enjoy as much consensus as possible.

11:45,Kate Forbes,,"The national performance framework is a vision that we want to deliver now and for generations to come, but it sets out the end destination that we want to get to, and it cannot replace the political day-to-day decision making that is required. For example, the committee has just heard the finance secretary talking about winter fuel payments. With regard to the choices in and around that, we want to reduce poverty, but there are a number of different ways to do that. There is the Scottish child payment, and there is building good, affordable homes.",2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt

11:45,Kate Forbes,,"More recently, as of May, the First Minister has been really clear that he wants there to be a focus on strategy and delivery. A bit of restructuring has been going on. People in the strategy directorate and the performance, delivery and resilience directorate are tasked with ensuring that we meet our aims, and they now own the national performance framework. In all the work that they do internally on monitoring delivery and strategy, they must be cognisant of the national performance framework, which provides the ultimate direction of travel.",2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt
11:45,John Mason,,"“Cognisant” is an interesting word. There is also the phrase “having regard to”.

Should we have a bit more stick or apply a bit more pressure on people?",2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt
11:45,Kate Forbes,,"There is definitely a lot more stick with the work that John Swinney, as the First Minister, has done in government during the early months of his tenure. I talked about restructuring. Under his leadership, the delivery function has been reformed so that delivery is measured and so that we ensure that we do what we say we are going to do. That is why this year’s programme for government is a lot punchier, because it is a lot easier to monitor progress against fewer hard-hitting actions than it is to do that against lots of nice actions that no one could disagree with.",2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt
11:45,Kate Forbes,,The programme for government has a tight focus primarily because John Swinney places such weight on monitoring delivery—he has tasked a team in the Government with focusing almost entirely on delivery.

The rigidity around measuring progress will also be applied to how our actions compare with the ambitions that have been set out in the national performance framework.,2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt

There is no way that only the Government can achieve any of the aims that are set out in the national performance framework; that would be the case only in a structure that was not a democracy.

The more that fair work principles are embedded in private sector organisations, the more likely it will be that people are paid a fair wage and that their wellbeing is considered, and the more likely it will be that we reduce poverty. That is a responsibility for the private sector. In a document such as the national performance framework, which is widely owned, it is inherent that there will be tensions. That is why I am open to the committee’s views on accountability and implementation. If too narrow an approach is taken that does not hold all of Scotland responsible for achieving the aims, we may miss the point of the national performance framework being a national document.",2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt

12:00,Michelle Thomson,,"Moving on, I want to pick up the convener’s comment about the references to “economic growth” being omitted. I have heard your responses to that, cabinet secretary, but I would just add an additional concern. It is my perception that, over the past few years, there has been a lack of clear long-term thinking. We have called this year’s budget scrutiny “A Strategic Approach”, and issues that we hear about often include the lack of multiyear funding and growing the tax base to fund things.

Indeed, SPICe suggested that bringing those things together created a more balanced and inclusive approach to economic development.

We have therefore focused far more explicitly on gender. For example, we have done that in the new care outcome, because we know that more women are involved in the business of delivering care. We have accepted the recommendation of the national advisory council on women and girls that we carry out a thematic gender review of the national performance framework. The themes that came through are reflected in the proposed revisions to the outcomes.

12:15,Kate Forbes,,"I think that we are, but I note that there are two big drivers of the short-term decision making. The first is the nature of the funding. We need, once and for all, to get beyond the year-to-year annual budget setting; I am hopeful that the UK Government might help us in that. Our local authorities need it, and we in Government need it. If we could get a really decent spending review from the UK Government—I think that the review is coming next spring—that could give us long-term certainty on funding and it would be much easier to plan for the longer term.",2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt
12:15,Kate Forbes,,"The second driver has been the number of short-term challenges with which we have been grappling. Emerging from the Covid pandemic, which in itself was a short-term emergency shock, we have then had the cost of living emergency shock and a number of additional pressures that are driven by the inflationary environment, and which have meant that we have had to take immediate decisions.",2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt
12:15,Kate Forbes,,"We have the inputs, which is the funding position, and the outputs, which is the demand.

12:15,Kate Forbes,,"I will make another brief point. Shona Robison has had to make very difficult choices, and I know that Michael Marra has been scrutinising those decisions and holding us all to account for them. However, if we can make some of those difficult decisions now, that sets us up to be able to think about funding for the longer term on some of the biggest and most impactful changes that are required to give others longer-term stability with regard to what actually works.",2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt
12:15,Michael Marra,,"I do not think that you will find any disagreement from the committee on that point. However, I have already cited a range of external observers who say that what you describe is exactly what is not happening with this Government, given its handling of public finances.",2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt
12:15,Michael Marra,,"You had a go at this when you were Cabinet Secretary for Finance and the Economy, in your resource spending review: you tried to take some decisions for the longer term and to talk about a strategy. However, Shona Robison later came to the committee and said that she was ditching that policy because it was “a blunt tool”. Is that not what happens to long-term thinking under this Government?",2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt
12:15,Kate Forbes,,"No, because I think that we are making those decisions. That resource spending review was published in 2022, and I still stand by it; I know the amount of work that went into producing it. Nevertheless, it was published immediately prior to the emergence of double-digit levels of inflation and pay deals that mirrored the rocketing cost of living. Good grown-up Governments do not simply make plans and then stick their fingers in their ears and ignore what is happening around them. Good Governments are conscious of what is happening while sticking to the long-term ambitions of their plan.",2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt

12:15,Michael Marra,,"I have one final question, on a slightly different area. It is on the point about the difference between the sustainable development goals and the national performance framework as a tool to drive performance. The framework, conceptually, is the basis on which we set outcomes and try to measure performance against them, whereas the sustainable development goals are “calls to action”, as they have been described; they essentially have funding pots set against them and positive actions that can be about aligning activity.",2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt
12:15,Michael Marra,,"In contrast, what you are doing with the framework, in essence, is setting out an organising principle for the civil service, as you described it. I find that the confusion between those two operating models, in terms of the bureaucracy, might actually be part of the problem rather than the solution, because those two things—the sustainable development goals and the national performance framework—are not the same.",2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt
12:15,Kate Forbes,,"That is a very interesting observation. You are right to say that there is a distinction between them. We are, as it were, trying to support the delivery of the sustainable development goals, but this is a Government document—in other words, an organising document. It is trying to embed the northern star of the UN sustainable development goals in our own work and in the work that we want other agencies and actors in Scotland to do.",2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt
12:15,Kate Forbes,,"However, I also think that the tension that you have talked about is what makes reporting so challenging. The ultimate reporting with regard to reducing poverty, for example, is that you have reduced poverty, and the ultimate aim of the environment or climate change objectives is that you meet the climate change goals. The key is how you measure that over time to know that you are on the right track. We have the reporting on the child poverty statistics, for example. They are not national performance framework statistics; they are Government statistics, but you can use them to say whether the national performance framework is achieving its aims.",2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt
12:15,Kate Forbes,,"That is why it is perhaps more messy than the committee would like.

12:15,Kate Forbes,,"It is hard—arguably, too hard. Again, the committee will have ideas on this. Although a lot of data is collated on a local basis—we know where there are higher levels of poverty, for example—that does not mean that the effectiveness of local bodies in tackling the issue is being monitored. We know where the starting point might be too high, but often, there is a lot of focus on what national Government is doing to tackle these things, while the role of local authorities is forgotten.",2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt
12:15,Kate Forbes,,"By its very nature, your question echoes Michael Marra’s question, in that we must not confuse political manifestos with the national performance framework. Every local authority around the country is made up of different political colours with different views on how to achieve a particular aim. Therefore, local authority administrations that are more aligned with your party might have very strong views on how to achieve economic prosperity, and that would be an indirect route to reducing poverty. On the other hand, others will be more explicit about aims and ambitions that are directly linked to the child poverty ambition. In a dictatorship, you might be able to just say, “Here’s the national performance framework. This is how we are going to do things around the country.” That is not our style, and, indeed, I do not think any of us wants to get to that point.",2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt

12:15,Liz Smith,,"You said earlier that one of the big asks from local authorities and stakeholders was for people to think outwith silos and to be able to read across outcomes, which would be very helpful.

If there are such local authorities, is the Scottish Government trying to encourage their work by saying, “You’ve done very well on this because you’ve managed to put things together”?",2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt
12:15,Kate Forbes,,"I will give an example. I am in Shetland because I was at the convention of the Highlands and Islands yesterday. As you will know, the convention covers all our rural, coastal and island areas from North Ayrshire up to Shetland, including Moray. The point of the convention is to learn from one another about how we are achieving goals that directly mirror those in the national performance framework. Yesterday, we shared case studies. The meeting was live streamed, so anybody can watch it.

As part of the review, they are working with the Office for National Statistics on how monitoring can be more quantifiable, rather than people just sharing anecdotes and stories or waiting for the child poverty statistics to be published or the statistics on economic performance—gross domestic product, employability and so on—that are published every month.

As the Deputy First Minister said, good practice on the qualitative side is important. That goes back to our ideas for the implementation plan, which will need to include how we highlight case studies, good practice and so on, including in relation to local government. Indeed, our national performance framework website includes such information at the moment. That will be important.",2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt

12:15,Liz Smith,,"My final question is for Kate Forbes. Earlier, we discussed how, perhaps in the past two or three years, some people—although not everybody—have felt that there has not been as much emphasis on the national performance framework as there had been previously and that, therefore, it has been difficult to meet the framework’s demands. Is one possible reason for that difficulty the fact that the framework is, in theory, very ambitious in trying to do some very difficult things, including combining very different objectives and considering the opportunity costs that are involved in all that? Mr Mason mentioned that the Scottish Government has added a few extra dimensions to the framework. Has that made things more difficult?",2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt
12:30,Kate Forbes,,"I do not necessarily share the premise, but I am conscious that stakeholders have expressed their views on that. When I was finance secretary a couple of years ago, I was responsible for the national performance framework, and the link in that world between inputs and outcomes was really visible then. In a sense, the budget is the area where it is easiest to build on the national performance framework. With my current brief—the economy brief—it is a little bit trickier to directly mirror that but, with the budget, it is easier, just in terms of the mechanics. The budget is an inherently mechanical thing and in that world it is much easier to link the budget directly to the national performance framework. For example, I found it a lot easier to come to committee and to directly map inputs to outcomes, and say that we chose to spend the money on an area directly for whatever reason.",2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt
12:30,Kate Forbes,,"A huge amount of work was done on embedding the national performance framework in budgets. To go back to what I said to Michael Marra, politics by its nature has to respond to emerging challenges, and the past few years have been absolutely turbulent, with the emergencies that have arisen around Covid and the cost of living. Governments have a duty to respond to those challenges. In a stable environment, you have the luxury of being able to directly link the national performance framework to the inputs.",2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt

In that world, you have a very different set of choices to make from those that you have in a world where everything remains equal. I think that we would all like things to remain stable and to be able to track inputs and outcomes simply and straightforwardly, but that is not the world that we live in. Who knows?

We need a focus on clear and measurable milestones to identify tangible improvements but, in our 2022 report on the national performance framework, we noted that, five years after the previous review, a number of NPF indicators had no data. What guarantees do we have this time that all indicators will provide data so that we can measure progress from the start?",2024-10-08,scottish_parliament_report_08_10_24.txt
12:30,Kate Forbes,,"That goes back to the point that Katie Allison made, which is that, basically, we do not collate our own data; we use data. It is a whole-Government responsibility to understand where we do not have data on things that we do, because, ultimately, every penny that we spend should have a demonstrable benefit to the people who raised the revenue in the first place to reinvest—in other words, taxpayers. There needs to be that data.

This is a complex programme and I accept that reform will not start or end in such a way as to mirror anniversaries or deadlines of particular strategies or reports.

I suspect that, in health and social care, for example, the investment that we make in primary care services is preventative spend. I am less clear about whether we are seeing that spending ring fenced in a public service reform programme.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
09:45,The Convener,,"That is really what we mean by preventative spend, is it not? It is about disinvesting in one area to invest somewhere else in order to have better outcomes and to save resources further down the line.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
09:45,Stephen Boyle,,"Yes. My recent report on the NHS in Scotland, which came out at the end of November or the beginning of December, talks about the sustainability of public services, the need for reform in where we are spending resource and the need for that to be supported in a way that will deliver better outcomes more affordably, and investment in preventative spend is absolutely part of that. However, I share your scepticism, convener. Use of the phrase “in due course” in the absence of the necessary deadlines and timescales makes it difficult for audit scrutiny and service users alike to track and monitor progress.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
09:45,The Convener,,"One of the things that the committee has expressed concern about in relation to reform concerns the issue that we started with, which is transparency. We have expressed concern about transparency in relation to capital budgets. We were hoping to see the capital pipeline about a year ago, but the Government has given various reasons why we have not been able to see it. They cover everything from the general election to budgets et cetera. One would have thought that, whether the capital budget is £5 billion, £6 billion or £7 billion, we would at least have a list of priority projects, whether they are new projects, maintenance projects or whatever else is included. Do you feel that the Government should do more to show the capital programme pipeline as part of the transparency that is required in any reform agenda?",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
09:45,Stephen Boyle,,"I am generally sympathetic with the tone of your question. There needs to be more transparency from the Government, not just on capital but on resource. Not having a medium-term financial strategy or the capital investment pipeline plan and, to analyse it further, the absence of an NHS capital plan are barriers to Parliament supporting effective choices and to the implementation of those choices by public bodies across the country.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
09:45,Stephen Boyle,,"On the capital point specifically, both the report that we are discussing today and the committee’s own publications have stated that the single estate is a key part of public service reform. How we use our land and buildings across the country is going to change. The way in which they were used in the previous 20 or 30 years does not reflect the way in which we are going to consume public services in the years to come. We have seen some progress on that—recently, we have heard about colleges making decisions about their estate and how they will use it—but there is still a lack of clarity across the piece about how we are going to use land and buildings. We will inevitably spend capital to create treatment centres and other new buildings for public services across the country, but we are also going to change how we use our existing estate. Drawing those two things together more coherently than we have done so far will be an important part of both transparency and the delivery of public services.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt

10:00,Stephen Boyle,,"In the reporting that you referenced, Mr Marra, there is consistency about the need for progress in public service reform—having clarity on the Government’s intent for what public services reform will look like, its fiscal sustainability and the outcomes that it will achieve. We have not yet seen enough of that. I have referenced a couple of times already the minister’s intention to produce a public service reform strategy.

Thus far, thankfully, the Government has not been unable to balance its budget, but some of the demand pressures are increasing—especially on social security—which might mean that the Government’s ability to intervene successfully becomes more challenged.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:00,Stephen Boyle,,"Fiona Diggle might want to touch on this.

That will be an important next step during 2025, subject to the timing of the various fiscal publications.

There is some irony in the fact that some of the public services that are being protected in terms of fiscal spending, especially health and social care, are the services that are perhaps experiencing the most challenges and the greatest need for reform at pace.

10:00,Stephen Boyle,,"That is a really important point.

10:00,Stephen Boyle,,"Going back to your earlier question, it is absolutely the case—we set this out in our reports—that some of Scotland’s colleges are facing severe pressure. We also know that colleges play a vital role both within their local communities and more widely in terms of Scotland’s skills and skills planning arrangements for the future. Bringing together all those objectives coherently to support colleges in making choices for the future will be key. At the moment, we are seeing colleges manage their financial position from one year to the next—as we have mentioned already, making redundancies where they need to in order to support financial balance. However, they are not doing that with the clarity of intent to support employers and learners in their areas in relation to their future direction.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:00,Michael Marra,,"You have been clear that that is partly due to the Government not having clarity of its own intent around post-school skills reform. Until the Government does that, how on earth are colleges meant to know? The idea is that we will have a public sector reform board and a change fund of £30 million, which accounts for 0.05 per cent of the overall budget. Will those things not simply be paying lip service unless work is actually done to say “This is where we want to go”?",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:00,Stephen Boyle,,"It is not yet clear to us, just as it is not clear to the committee, how the £30 million will be deployed or what the intent behind the change fund is. Relative to the overall scale of challenge, it may be an early contribution to changing delivery of service. Clarity of intent will be much more important, so that the Government’s public service vision is clear—not just to colleges but to the NHS and other public services—in order to support the delivery of the very impressive and important case studies that the committee has seen. The Government needs to set out how those will all be brought together and say what public service reform will deliver across the piece to support fiscal sustainability and improved outcomes.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt

10:00,Liz Smith,,"Mr Boyle, I refer back to Mr Marra’s earlier questions, when he—quite rightly—focused on some of the concerns that we have as a committee about how we seem to be standing still. Your report “Fiscal sustainability and reform in Scotland”—particularly in paragraph 6, in which you say that you have difficulty in being able to scrutinise some aspects of the fiscal situation because you are missing documents and there is not enough transparency—encapsulates our frustrations. We have heard similar concerns from the Scottish Fiscal Commission. This committee has issued several reports over recent years setting out our real, serious difficulty in relation to the lack of transparency and accountability. Do you think that Parliament having a finance bill, which obviously we do not have right now, might help with transparency and accountability?",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt

10:00,Liz Smith,,"Can I push you a little bit more? I know that you cannot make policy.

10:00,Liz Smith,,"I have heard complaints from across the political spectrum in Parliament that we are not doing enough to fully scrutinise budgets. Our committee does a huge amount of the heavy lifting on that work, for obvious reasons, and some other committees do a bit, but we are not getting the depth of scrutiny that perhaps we need. I am interested in whether you think that a finance bill might help that situation, because—let us be honest—we are standing still when it comes to the problem of transparency and we have not been able to move on.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:00,Stephen Boyle,,"If you will permit me, I can say a couple of things. One is that we recognise the description of a lack of transparency and the need for more clarity around data and documents to support better scrutiny. I absolutely support that description; it is consistent with our own reporting, and goes back to the work of your predecessor committee and the budget process review group, which explored many of these themes. There is a clarity of intent to have a better understanding of Scotland’s public finances, given the changes that came through, especially in the Scotland Act 2016, and to have much better information. Given the increasing complexity of Scotland’s public finances, we are not there yet.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:00,Stephen Boyle,,"However, I would avoid falling in behind support for a finance bill, primarily because I would not want to pin my colours to the mast and say that that would be the only, or the next, mechanism for achieving that. I am sure that an alternative case could be made that we can achieve better scrutiny without legislation. Indeed, I think that we should be achieving better scrutiny through better provision of information and data to both the Fiscal Commission and the committee, as well as to us for audit purposes, to support that scrutiny.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:00,Liz Smith,,"That is an interesting point, because there is a difference between having the right data available and scrutinising that data. Do you think that there are problems in both departments? Namely, is there some data lacking that we really must have to hand to enable us to be more effective in our budget scrutiny, or is there something lacking in the scrutiny process, or is it perhaps both?",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:00,Stephen Boyle,,"It is probably both. Fiona Diggle might want to come in on assessment of the detail, but I can say that we are lacking data specifically on workforce. In our reporting on the Scottish Government’s workforce, we have pointed that out as a key theme. The information that the Fiscal Commission received from the Government on workforce, which would have allowed it to make an informed assessment, was also incomplete. There was a follow-through from my assessment of that.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt

10:00,Liz Smith,,"There is a frustration, Mr Boyle. As the convener said, we have highlighted the issue several times in our reports. Mr Marra commented that Audit Scotland reports have come out recently in which it is a constant theme. We have also heard it from the Scottish Fiscal Commission.

10:15,John Mason,,"One of the themes of your report, which comes up quite a lot, is that the Government is reacting to events and does not have a longer-term plan. However, is there not a certain inevitability of that happening in Scotland? For example, the UK Government came in and suddenly introduced a pay increase that was higher than we had previously expected as well as a national insurance increase. Those are events that most of us had not anticipated. What is the Government to do? Surely it simply has to react in the short term.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:15,Stephen Boyle,,"John Mason is right. We set out in the report—specifically in exhibit 2—some of the drivers for the Scottish budget. We particularly note the UK fiscal environment and decisions, especially following the change of Government in the UK and the resultant UK Government budget. The Scottish Government absolutely had to respond to those events. We see that some of that, especially around national insurance, is, to a degree, unresolved in the Scottish budget.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:15,Stephen Boyle,,"However, from our perspective, that is not the whole picture. More regular updates of fiscal documentation in Scotland might allow for the consideration of such scenarios. No scenario is going to get it entirely right, that is for sure; however, the fact is that we do not have a medium-term fiscal strategy that is updated and that might have allowed for some of those changes to be considered, which might have helped the Government to make decisions as it went through its own budget process.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:15,Stephen Boyle,,"That said, I agree with the premise of Mr Mason’s question. Given the dynamic of the fiscal framework between the Scottish and UK Governments, it is clear that UK Government decisions will have a direct bearing on the Scottish budget.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:15,John Mason,,"Even if we had a medium-term or a long-term or a whatever-number-of-years strategy or plan, it would simply all get thrown by some kind of Westminster decision, such as that on national insurance. I begin to wonder what the point of saying, “This is what we are going to do in 2030,” is, when so many things could happen between now and then. Are we being unrealistic in expecting medium and longer-term planning?",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:15,Stephen Boyle,,No. I would argue that it is all the more important to have effective medium and longer-term planning.,2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:15,Stephen Boyle,,"It is unlikely that any scenario that is set out will come to pass directly—even the forward projections that are included in the draft budget that the committee is considering will probably not come to pass directly. However, without a scenario that you can at least draw upon, and that provides a starting point from which to respond to fiscal events in the UK or wider economic shocks, you will be playing catch-up.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt

10:15,Stephen Boyle,,"One of the related points that we set out in today’s report is that the Scottish Government will probably be able to make those decisions more successfully if it has a better understanding of its cost base. We have set out in the report that workforce spending, health and social care, and social security are all consuming more of the budget, which raises the question of what levers the Government has. Medium-term and longer-term planning are absolutely complementary to its making those decisions when it needs to.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:15,John Mason,,"Yet, almost counter to that, if the Government does not make longer-term commitments, in a sense, it would have more flexibility. The two kind of go together. If it gave just one-year grants to the third sector, it would have total flexibility to stop those grants the next year, and yet the third sector is always demanding, or asking for, a longer-term plan. If we get a longer-term plan from Westminster, that would obviously help, and then we could have a longer-term plan that would help local government and the third sector following on from that.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt

10:15,John Mason,,"Maybe I am not putting it very clearly. It seems to me that there is a tension between longer-term planning and commitments on the one hand, which, in a sense, tie the Government’s hands, and on the other, doing short-term things that do not tie our hands, which is a more flexible approach, but is less helpful to the third sector and local government.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt

The Government could intervene and say that the funding arrangements, whether they be for the third sector or local government, are up for grabs every year, and there should be a zero-based budgeting approach.

I do not think that anyone would argue that that is a desirable position for the Government to be in. It is having to react to balance its budget, and it has done so successfully, but it will become harder and harder to anticipate. If it still has to deploy emergency spending controls, where it turns the tap off will be harder to secure, for the reasons that we set out in the report.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt

10:15,Fiona Diggle,,"To link between your two questions, the report sets out that the Scottish Government does not have a clear understanding of where it can flex its budget easily for short-term fluctuations or long-term commitments, given that so much of the budget fixed. There are limits to be changed and that creates some of the pressure that we see in the budget.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:15,John Mason,,"What would that mean? What is it that the Government does not understand? It has flexed the budget successfully during the year in the past two years. One scenario would be that, if it was you and me personally, we would try to save money so that, if we have a bad year, we would have some savings. However, the Government effectively cannot do that, because we have a limit on how much we can save, and because there is huge political pressure against saving money, when all the parties want us to spend every single penny. I am struggling to understand what the Government is missing, what it is not doing that it should be doing.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:15,Fiona Diggle,,"It should have an understanding of its cost base in-year, which relates to the Auditor General’s point about our understanding of workforce costs and capital spend.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:15,Stephen Boyle,,"A couple of examples of where spending has been reduced in the past two or three years are mental health spend, employability and so forth, and I am sure that the committee is familiar with the fact that they were reduced because there were underspends in some of those budget lines, where they were projected not to be required. At the same time, we were not clear that there was evidence of assessment of the outcomes that would be interrupted by the changes to those lines. It is perhaps about moving away from what might be an opportunistic approach to reducing spending to one that is planned in advance and saying that, if there is going to be a shock, here is where we will go, rather than making a call on the progress of budget lines mid-year.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:15,John Mason,,"I do not want to keep pursuing this for ever. When the Government sets out the budget, should it also say how, if we were to get an extra billion pounds during the year from Westminster or for some other reason, we would spend that extra billion pounds or, if funds from Westminster or our tax revenues were to fall by a billion pounds, how we would save a billion pounds? Do you want it to be so specific that, at the beginning of the year, we say, “This is the budget that we’re hoping for, but this is what we would do if we didn’t manage it”?",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:15,Stephen Boyle,,"I will perhaps not get drawn into the absolute specifics of what scenarios would look like. We support the premise that more detailed and transparent scenario planning will be helpful in supporting effective budget management, as will parliamentary and public scrutiny of the budget in the event that there are either benefits or shocks to the fiscal position during the year.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:15,John Mason,,"Do you accept that that is quite difficult for the Government? Even if it does emergency planning a year ahead, there is still a limited number of spaces where it can save money.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:15,Stephen Boyle,,"Indeed, and again, that supports the point that we make in the report about the fact that the number of levers that the Government has at its disposal is reducing, especially with the growth in workforce and commitments in terms of health and social care and social security. It needs clarity about where it will go in the event of facing a downside shock, in particular.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:15,John Mason,,"I turn to public sector reform. In paragraph 105 you say that public sector reform requires “significant investment”. There is the example of Registers of Scotland, which will be coming up, among others, in the next evidence session. Registers of Scotland seems to have managed to reform, digitise, do a lot of that kind of stuff and save on 10 per cent of its jobs—all without extra investment. It has just done that as part of its routine working. Is that possible on a bigger scale?",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:15,Stephen Boyle,,"Both those things can be true. Public service reform can be delivered really successfully—I suspect that you will hear more about that this morning—through digitalisation to deliver improved outcomes and reduced costs. Whether it can be delivered at scale across the country is less certain. We are looking for the Government—not Audit Scotland—to put numbers on what public service reform can achieve and what investment is required to deliver it. My suspicion and expectation is that, to deliver public service reform, investment will be required, whether in digital services or artificial intelligence or through how we use our estate; it will require spend to get from where we are today to the vision of public service delivery for the years to come.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:15,Stephen Boyle,,"I think that both things are true. We can achieve some successful projects, but, if we are talking about moving to different models of service delivery and structural change, which is also included in the public service reform material, history has shown us that enabling funding to deliver that kind of change will require a growth in costs in the short term.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:15,John Mason,,"Although we might improve outcomes a bit, does public service reform basically mean cutting jobs?",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:15,Stephen Boyle,,"I do not think that that is necessarily a given. To return to questions from earlier this morning, I note that the Scottish Government has been clear that, although the Scottish public sector workforce numbers have grown, it intends to right-size the workforce. It is about clarity and clearly setting out in the workforce numbers how it intends to deliver a sustainable model of public services in the years to come. The next step is to bring together all these themes in terms of documentation, expenditure and outcomes.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:15,Ross Greer,,"Thanks, convener. I am conscious of time, so I have just one question.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:15,Ross Greer,,"Auditor General, you mentioned in opening that there are lots of examples of public sector reform—we will hear some in a moment. However, ultimately, the issue is the lack of coherence and direction from the Government. Are you aware of any examples of effective reform in the Scottish public sector that either have happened or are on-going as a result of ministerial direction? I do not mean those that are off the back of an initiative by an individual organisation or public body; I mean those that are a direct result of Scottish ministers’ involvement in direction setting.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:15,Stephen Boyle,,I might need to think about that a bit more carefully to track the specific actions of ministers. Fiona Diggle might offer one or two examples in a moment. We would need to dig into examples in a bit more detail to understand the precise role that ministers played at a particular point that then led to public service reform.,2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:15,Stephen Boyle,,"The example that I would offer—again, I might need to check some of the detail behind this—is the increase in the use of NHS Near Me during the response to Covid. That is an example of acceleration of digitisation to deliver services, and that approach has been sustained.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:15,Stephen Boyle,,I will check with Fiona Diggle whether she has anything to add.,2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Fiona Diggle,,"As part of the report, we did not look in detail at any particular workstreams of reform, so we cannot provide that sort of information. The report looked more at the overall level of the public service reform programme.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Ross Greer,,Thanks very much—I appreciate that.,2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Craig Hoy,,"Good morning, Mr Boyle—it is nice to see you again. You have covered quite a lot of the things that I was going to ask about, but I want to briefly ask about exhibit 4 in your report. You have talked about the importance of preventative spend and curing social ills rather than simply treating them. The left-hand column in exhibit 4 sets out areas of Scottish public spending that have been decreased, and those seem to be in what could be perceived to be preventative or curing areas.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Craig Hoy,,"You just talked about mental health and employability, the budgets for both of which have suffered significant decreases in recent years. There has been an increase in the number of people on adult disability benefit in Scotland. Between 2022 and 2024, there was, I think, an increase of 80,000 in the number of people whose principal reason for claiming related to mental health issues. If I were to look at a similar table for another country, would I find that Scotland is now out of step in the way in which we are dealing with those upstream problems? For example, we have had cuts in the enterprise, trade and investment budget, the learning budget, the Scottish Funding Council budget, the active travel budget and, as you said, the mental health budget, yet we are seeing a significant increase in social security benefits. Is that typical for equivalent countries?",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Stephen Boyle,,"Again, Fiona Diggle can perhaps share any information on international comparisons and read-across that we sought to undertake. However, generally with our reports, we do not seek to draw a comparison with policy choices that other jurisdictions make. Having said that, there is a point that we are keen to explore in the audit that we are undertaking on the adult disability payment. Through that programme of expenditure, which has been in place for a number of years, and more generally through its work, Social Security Scotland has set out quite clearly that it wants to achieve a different approach and ethos compared to its assessment of the approach of the Department for Work and Pensions. We also want to make that a bit broader and consider whether that different approach is connected to the employability arrangements and so on.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Stephen Boyle,,"I will also refer to the funding decreases for the Scottish Funding Council, which are noted in the report, and compare that to the position in which Scotland’s colleges currently find themselves. Ultimately, those will be policy choices, but what we draw attention to in the report is the consistency and coherence of the policy choices between one budget and the next.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Stephen Boyle,,I invite Fiona Diggle to come in if she wants to add anything.,2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Fiona Diggle,,"We did not specifically compare the types of changes to an international context but, as we reference in the report, we reviewed the impact assessments. I highlight the example from Wales, where it was clear that, when changes were made to the budget, the implications that those would have for outcomes and for people were set out clearly, which was really helpful. For the emergency budget review in 2022, there were good examples of the implications of the changes being set out.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Craig Hoy,,"Could you work with the Scottish Government to better define what preventative expenditure actually is? When we put it to the Government that social security expenditure is not necessarily an investment or preventative, it said that that expenditure prevents people from living in poverty and therefore is preventative. To try to crack that issue, is there more work that you can do to help to create definitions so that we do not end up unintentionally or intentionally defining expenditure that is not preventative as being preventative?",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Stephen Boyle,,"That is a helpful prompt, which we can take away and consider in relation to our own language. Ultimately, it is about outcomes and fiscal balance at the same time. It is perhaps unhelpful to have broad and sweeping definitions if those are a barrier to audit or scrutiny arrangements. We can take that point away for our engagement with Government.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Craig Hoy,,"On public sector reform, it strikes me that, given the number of Government agencies and bodies, shared services would be one of the ways to go. Is the Government sufficiently committed to providing leadership in relation to making bodies consider how they can remould the way in which they operate services, and particularly back office and corporate functions?",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Stephen Boyle,,"The committee might be familiar with the fact that, over the past few months, the Scottish Government has undertaken a considerable amount of work with public bodies to assess what they are spending on what might be called back-office functions—although that is perhaps a bit of a sweeping generalisation. There is correspondence from the minister setting out the current scale of spending in Scotland on back-office functions.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Stephen Boyle,,"That is a positive development. Beginning to understand its cost base allows the Government to make informed choices about how it plans to deliver corporate support activities across the piece. I do not think that it is unreasonable for me to say that there has been relatively limited progress over the past 10 to 15 years on sharing services and back-office functions and, if there are opportunities to do that successfully, that is a positive development on the part of the Government.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Michelle Thomson,,"Good morning, Auditor General, and thank you for joining us. I just have a couple of questions, as I am mindful of the time. The first is a slightly technical question that follows on from Mr Hoy’s questions. In the update that it gave in December 2024, the Government stated that it was taking",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Stephen Boyle,,"I think that that is right. Fiona Diggle might want to comment on the detail of the definitions, but it goes back to some of the discussion that we have had already this morning, especially referencing the stated intention to revise governance arrangements so that there is clarity around leadership and intent from the public service reform programme, especially on what the Government expects to set out in its strategy. For me, that is the key next step, and I welcome the minister’s acknowledgement of that. There is a consistency in the recommendations that we make in the report on the need for clarity of intent, which can be tracked and monitored in relation to cascade savings and what will be achieved by them.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt

10:30,Michelle Thomson,,"I will move on to my next question. I have not seen culture mentioned specifically in your report. It is a very good report, but the reference to culture is implicit, rather than explicit, in some of the commentary, such as that on transparency and leadership, for example.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Michelle Thomson,,"Considering your understanding of the culture that prevails and that you have seen, how confident are you that changes can be made, given that the best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour?",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Stephen Boyle,,"I recognise the points that you make about the inherent challenges in a programme of public service reform. Regarding the risk around protectionist behaviours, people will be thinking about their own roles and jobs. In some cases, a fear of change will give rise to barriers that will need to be overcome to deliver a successful programme of change. Persuading people that the programme is necessary will be a fundamental next step.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Stephen Boyle,,"There are one or two warning signs in our report. As has already been mentioned this morning, the Government had to go out to public bodies two or three times to get examples of public service reform that could be tracked and to be satisfied that there is buy-in. It is a matter of striking the right balance, adopting what is both a bottom-up and top-down approach to public service reform.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Stephen Boyle,,"For me, there is enough evidence that public service reform and change is necessary—given the fiscal position that Scotland is in—in order to deliver better outcomes and fiscal balance. I agree with you, however, that it will be vitally important to have arrangements that give people confidence that change can be delivered.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Stephen Boyle,,"We are conscious of that, too. It might be assumed that we, as auditors, will pounce on the first example of ambition or public service reform that does not go to plan and will produce a statutory report on that, but we will be careful about that. If public service reform and change has to happen in Scotland, the conditions across the piece have to be right to strike the right balance culturally, and in the resultant scrutiny and audit.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt

10:30,Stephen Boyle,,"We will do that, and we are factoring that in across our work. I make reference to culture in some of my reports. Realistically, that has probably been more where culture has not been a successful contributor to change or organisational behaviour. For the Government, setting the tone about the right conditions for supporting change will be vital, and culture is fundamental to that.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt

10:30,The Convener,,"I intend to allow around 90 minutes for the evidence session, and I would like it to be a discussion between us all. If witnesses or members would like to be brought into the discussion, they should please indicate that to the clerks and I can call them. Someone has to be the first victim, so I will ask Jane Morrison-Ross to get the ball rolling. The Scottish Government will drive forward a renewed focus on expanding the tax base and tax revenues by progressing specific economic activities with the potential to grow the economy and get more people into work. What is your view on that?",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Jane Morrison-Ross,South of Scotland Enterprise,"In the south of Scotland, we have been putting a lot of effort into getting more people engaged in economic activity. We were successful in securing the pathfinders pilot project, so an entire piece of work has been dedicated to getting people into entrepreneurial activity who would not normally consider that to be an option for them. Therefore, we have been trying to reach people who are not typically reached through more traditional methods. Coupled with that, we have an entire workstream that is focused on innovation and entrepreneurship. We have specialist coaches who have been working with young people, underrepresented founders and women to encourage them into enterprise activities.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Jane Morrison-Ross,South of Scotland Enterprise,"We also work with the developing the young workforce network and other partners such as the chambers of commerce to ensure that we engage with business at an early stage.

Coupled with a deep understanding of the rural economies and the key sectors in the south, that has helped us to identify new and emerging opportunities.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Jane Morrison-Ross,South of Scotland Enterprise,"We are trying very much to be a data-driven organisation and to ensure that we are aware of where the opportunities are. A good example of that is the work that we did last year with Scottish Development International. We launched the Invest in South of Scotland website, and we have seen a 400 per cent increase in inward investment opportunities as well as a growing awareness of the potential for businesses to come to the south of Scotland to relocate or to grow, or in relation to the opportunities around natural capital, energy transition, regenerative agriculture and so on.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Jane Morrison-Ross,South of Scotland Enterprise,"Therefore, there has been a focus on growing the tax base but in an aligned way, because it is really important to look at where the opportunities and intersections are across all those things.

10:30,Ross Greer,,"One of the most interesting recent examples of work on public sector reform has been the Scottish Government’s pilot of the reduced working week, which is sometimes called the four-day working week.

10:30,Jane Morrison-Ross,,"We have seen an incredible decrease in the rates of absence for both sickness and stress-related or mental health-related reasons. We have had a 92 per cent increase in staff morale, which may not be unexpected. Critically, we have seen no decrease at all in productivity. One success marker for our organisation is that, although we have had two or three really significant internal organisational situations in the past year, following the unexpected loss of colleagues, we have, even allowing for those unprecedented circumstances, seen no decrease at all in productivity.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Jane Morrison-Ross,,"We have just undertaken another piece of external research to ensure that we really understand what our clients, stakeholders and customers feel. Some did not realise that we were doing the pilot, because they had seen absolutely no change: the majority—around 88 per cent—had seen no impact on or decrease in productivity. Some of the feedback that we have had shows that any difficulty that organisations found in arranging meetings with us was actually caused by normal staff working patterns and not by the pilot. We already had around 38 per cent of the workforce on flexible working patterns, and the pilot has allowed us to offer an alternative without having to offer 140 different working patterns. Overall, the pilot has been exceptionally positive both internally and externally.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Jane Morrison-Ross,,"The biggest challenge came from branding.

That branding could be realigned in the future.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Craig Hoy,,"My question is also about workforce issues. I note that you currently have a freeze on essential recruitment and a head count of 145. We have just been discussing public sector reform with the Auditor General, including reforms to structures and to the workforce. The private sector organisations that you work with will be seeing a dramatic shift in the needs and skills of their own workforces. One current issue right across the public sector in Scotland is the assumption against compulsory redundancies. As you reform and look at your own structure and workforce, would lifting that restriction on compulsory redundancies be helpful in ensuring that your organisation is truly match fit for the challenge of delivering for enterprise in the south of Scotland?",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Jane Morrison-Ross,,"That came up at a previous meeting that we attended along with Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise.

We have seen valued members of staff leave the organisation, whether through promotion, retirement or development. Some of those posts are critical and need to be filled, so, naturally, we need to put someone in place. If we had the ability to transform the service in certain areas where those skill sets are not required, it would build in flexibility and allow those members of staff to move on to other roles while ensuring that FSS retains the key critical skill sets that are required. I support the flexibility of that approach.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt

10:30,Chris Kerr,Registers of Scotland,"Good morning, convener. We are on track to deliver a 10 per cent reduction in head count over our current corporate plan period, which takes us up to 2027. There are probably three key elements that underpin that, two of which are by design and one of which, I have to confess, is not.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Chris Kerr,Registers of Scotland,"The first element is that organisations like Registers of Scotland, with the history that they have, can face difficulties as legislation moves away from paper-based systems and towards digital systems. The Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012 removed that difficulty for us. It was a far-sighted piece of legislation that came through the Parliament and allowed us the opportunity to move towards offering digital services. Clearing that legislative hurdle made a big difference.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Chris Kerr,Registers of Scotland,"The second element, which was not by design, is that uptake of digital services was greatly accelerated as a consequence of the lockdown. As solicitors moved into their houses and away from their offices—our colleagues did the same in that period—moving on to those digital services became essential. That helped us to drive uptake much more quickly than we would otherwise have been able to, although the organisation deserves some credit for grasping the opportunity that presented itself.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Chris Kerr,Registers of Scotland,"The third element is our funding model, which we mentioned in our submission to the committee. By and large, Registers of Scotland does not take funding from central Government. We are funded by fees that we charge, which largely depend on the housing market. There are exceptions but, in general, the predictability of housing market income allows us to invest over several years. I know that that can be more difficult for colleagues around the table, as they are dependent on the budget settlement that they get every year, whereas we do not have that challenge. We have to make careful and considered investments, but the opportunity to do so over many years makes a big difference.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
10:30,Chris Kerr,Registers of Scotland,"Technology is an important aspect, but it is not the only aspect. The people, the process and the cultural aspects of such digital change are also incredibly important.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:00,Chris Kerr,Registers of Scotland,"Finally, on the point about restrictions on compulsory redundancies, I agree with colleagues around the room about the need for flexibility. However, Registers of Scotland expects that we will deliver the 10 per cent reduction that we have mentioned through natural attrition. Due to the demographics of our organisation, we have a lot of people who are approaching retirement and we expect that to give us the 10 per cent reduction. We do not need redundancies in order to deliver that reduction, but I agree with colleagues on the need for flexibility.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:00,The Convener,,By when do you intend to deliver that reduction?,2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt

11:00,Lynne Raeside,,You will be aware that we are awaiting the outcome of a consultation on the post-16 funding body landscape.

11:00,Lynne Raeside,,"That direction is quite clear and it is part of a programme of post-16 reform that has five projects in total. Those are the funding body landscape, skills planning, apprenticeship reform, the careers service and the post-16 qualification landscape. Through that programme of reform, the “Purpose and Principles for Post-School Education, Research and Skills” statement that was published in 2023, which the post-16 reform is helping to deliver, and our letter of guidance from Scottish Ministers, we feel that we have direction on the way forward for the sectors.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:00,Michael Marra,,"College principals and board chairs would disagree with you. They tell me and others that, essentially, they do not know what they are meant to be doing as organisations, what areas they are meant to be focusing on and what their priorities are. The statement of purpose and principles was derided pretty universally as a watered-down version of what had been a broader reform programme.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:00,Michael Marra,,"Essentially, there is another consultation about the previous piece of work, and the Withers review. Are we not limited by the absence of a real direction in the agenda?

11:00,Alison Irvine,,"Let me give you some context. As you know, Transport Scotland is an executive agency of the Scottish Government, but we are also a sponsor for eight or nine public bodies, ranging in size from ScotRail and CalMac Ferries all the way down to the Scottish Road Works Commissioner.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:00,Alison Irvine,,"One impact of Covid that hit the transport sector is on the way in which people use our public transport systems. You will have seen it yourselves: hybrid working, people not coming into the office as much, different use of outdoor spaces, effects on retail, and things like that. We have also been impacted significantly by inflationary costs, particularly of fuel, for our rail and ferry fleets et cetera. That has meant that an increasing amount of revenue spend is required to support the public transport system. A number of workstreams are under way to help to bring that about.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:00,Alison Irvine,,"First and foremost, we need to encourage more people to use the public transport system, because the more people who use it, the greater the revenue that we are able to generate. That reduces the amount of support that the Government needs to provide. How do we do that? We do it by making sure that we have resilient and reliable services. That is where our focus is first and foremost.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:00,Alison Irvine,,"I will pick up on the rail sector first and then talk briefly about the ferries sector. In the rail sector, over the last period, there has been about a 7 per cent increase in the number of services that are being used. We are looking to increase the number of ScotRail drivers, in order to reduce our reliance on rest-day working. That will help us with a number of industrial relations risks. We are also looking at how to bring in an integrated ticketing platform across our public transport system. That would involve all modes of transport, and, as you would expect, it would require a degree of consistency and some governance changes across all the different modes. So, a number of things are on-going in the rail sector.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:00,Alison Irvine,,"In the ferries sector, our focus is obviously on bringing the new vessels into the fleet and ensuring that we have a forward programme for investment both for future ferries and for ports, to help deal with the reliability issues. That gives you a flavour of the things that we are doing.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:00,Alison Irvine,,"Going back to the rail sector, I would highlight the interdependency between track and train, and the work that we are doing with Network Rail and with ScotRail—which is the primary operator in Scotland—to drive efficiencies in how those two organisations work together to improve outcomes and reduce costs.

At previous committee meetings—probably of the Net Zero, Energy and Transport Committee rather than this committee—I have talked about some of the complexities that are associated with that. That is the first stage. In October 2025, we should be in a position to have moved to that direct award. We then need to turn our heads to what is next.

11:00,Liz Smith,,"I have a quick question on your dilemma of how to ensure that more people use public transport as you try to rationalise the workforce.

How will you go about making those two difficult pieces of the jigsaw come together?",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt

In addition to the sponsored bodies that you engage with, you have committed a considerable amount of money to Sustrans through a number of programmes—principally, the places for everyone programme. I understand that that programme is coming to an end and that you will move to a model whereby you directly fund councils for active travel.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:00,Craig Hoy,,"Obviously, that was an innovative way of funding those projects and developments but, bearing in mind that Sustrans is a charity and also a lobbying organisation, does the fact that you are moving to a model whereby you fund councils directly reflect any concerns about delivering those services through such a model?",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:00,Alison Irvine,,"You have almost answered your own question. The model that we had with Sustrans—in particular through the places for everyone programme—worked really well; however, it is no longer sustainable, given the scale of the investment that ministers are now choosing to make in active travel. It is too much of a risk for Sustrans as a charity to maintain. It was a joint decision to draw places for everyone to an end. By no means was it something that we imposed on Sustrans. Reaching that decision jointly was important, because it is important to recognise the success of what Sustrans has done for us as a country, in raising the standard of the active travel and behaviour change work that we got under way.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:00,Alison Irvine,,"The question now is how we transform that work and empower local authorities to take on that role because, given that they are transport authorities and roads authorities, the responsibility and decision making probably sits better with them.

11:15,Craig Hoy,,"You will be aware that there is considerable unease among local authorities about money being passed down to them on a ring-fenced or hypothecated basis.

11:15,Alison Irvine,,"We continually discuss that with local authorities. Different funds are allocated for slightly different purposes and by different means.

11:15,Michael Marra,,"I suppose that what you are describing, Alison, is the changes that you are making in Transport Scotland to increase demand for public transport, and that is you meeting the mandate that is set out for you. I am interested in whether organisations feel that they have the agency to respond to the broader vectors with regard to the need for reform, not just the financial limitations of budgets—Garry McEwan mentioned the downward pressure on budgets—but the external pressures of demographic change, climate change and technological change, and to adapt what they are doing.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt

11:15,Mary Morgan,NHS National Services Scotland,"A burning platform can be something that is absolutely in flames and that requires an emergency response on a national basis, with our working together as a single system to resolve a problem that arises, or it can be something that is smouldering and lets us see that we have a compelling case for change in the longer term. For example, everyone has talked about digital components, but digital components have an end because contracts come to an end. That is an opportunity to make a change and to plan for it. We have not always been good at doing that—sometimes, time runs away from us.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:15,Mary Morgan,NHS National Services Scotland,"There is no shortage of work for any of us, certainly in the health system.

11:15,Mary Morgan,NHS National Services Scotland,I was also quite taken by one of my colleagues speaking about digital change not being everything. It is about people. How do we change people and have a flexible workforce? Some of the skills that are becoming in short supply might create a burning platform for us whereby we have that compelling case for change—to think about what the future will look like for the skills that are needed for people in Scotland.,2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:15,The Convener,,"You said that digitalisation is not the answer to everything.

As the committee has heard today, there is no “one size fits all” for public service reform, and it is really important that that message is heard loud and clear. It is about more than doing our jobs. On my capacity as a leader to drive change and have foresight, looking at demographic change, where the key risks are and all the rest of it, that is what the job is, and I have teams that help me to do that. I have teams that forecast future demand and teams that monitor current demand. I have people doing all that analysis, which is part and parcel of the job.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:15,Alison Irvine,,"I came in at the tail end of the Auditor General’s evidence and I thought that it would be good to flag up a couple of things and get some further thoughts on them. One is the multiyear funding point and the other is about culture. You do not need me to tell you this but, for a variety of reasons, it takes a long time to deliver a project in the transport sector. I will not go into those reasons now, as other committees have looked at them in great detail. However, having a multiyear funding deal would help us, the construction sector and local authorities to have a bit more certainty about where we are likely to be developing projects and so on, which would help to drive a degree of efficiencies. It is good that there will be a spending review from the UK Government. That will make its way through the Scottish Government and allow us to start to present infrastructure projects.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:15,Alison Irvine,,Chris Kerr mentioned culture change in relation to the digital transition. We have a culture change challenge around the move from a commercial contract to a public service contract. ScotRail was run under a franchise for a number of years; it is now under public ownership. The CalMac contracts will move into that same place. I will be putting a great deal of focus on that to ensure that we have the right culture in Transport Scotland and that the public bodies feel empowered to have the right culture around that public service ethos.,2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:15,The Convener,,"How important is transparency in that culture? My experience with Transport Scotland is that transparency is not important at all. For example, I have asked questions for five years on a specific project in my constituency, and the answer that I continue to get—when I ask in the chamber and through written questions and so on—is that Transport Scotland is currently progressing through the necessary governance procedures.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:15,The Convener,,"I have asked what those governance procedures are and I am still waiting to hear, three or four years later. Regarding one project, I got told on 17 November 2021 that I would be kept informed. Three and a half years later, I still have not been given an update on that specific project.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:15,Alison Irvine,,"As you are the chair of the committee, I can probably guess what those projects are, but I will give you a more general answer.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:15,Alison Irvine,,"One of the downsides of having a long-term infrastructure plan is that people will have projects that they are particularly interested in but the timescale does not align with what they want. We get that quite a lot in transport, because people like transport projects—they like more services and more infrastructure. There is then a need for a leadership perspective. It is the job of politicians to make the case for their own constituents in their own areas. My job is to look at transport in the whole of Scotland and to provide ministers with the best advice on where to invest and on what decisions and recommendations to make.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:15,The Convener,,"That is a “moving swiftly on” answer. However, in terms of transparency, if I ask a specific question about what the governance procedures are, because constituents and community organisations are asking me directly, is it not a courtesy, apart from anything else, to respond and say, “These are the procedures and this is how long it is going to take to wade through them,” rather than just present this blank wall? I have to say that that seems to be unique to Transport Scotland. I am not aware of any other public body where, if I ask a direct question, three or four years later, I still have not had an answer, even though I have asked it at every level that it is possible to ask it at.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt

11:15,Lynne Raeside,,"On Mr Marra’s question about having the agency to make change, the SFC is the data authority for Scotland’s colleges and we also support the Higher Education Statistics Agency in being the data authority for universities.

We use that data ourselves but we also share it with other partners across the public sector, including the Scottish Government, colleges and universities.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:15,Lynne Raeside,,"Our digitalisation programme has allowed us to invest in that data. We are now working to build a unified data platform. That has been through our own agency and has not been driven by Scottish ministers. We are developing a unified data platform, which will make it much easier for us to share that data with other partners, so that we can make data-led and evidence-based decisions across the whole of the public sector in relation to Scotland’s colleges, which will help with national skills planning and provision planning. We will also look at demographics and where provision should be, and the social demographics that will drive provision.

One of the biggest public sector reforms in recent years has been the changes to the police and the fire service, which went from having eight local boards to one national board.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:30,John Mason,,"I do not expect you to answer all the questions, but how would that work with regard to the health service? Would it come from the health boards saying, “We want to join up with each other,” or does it need to come from the top, with the Government, saying, “We are going to put you all together”? Is there space for doing a bit more nationally or a bit less nationally?",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:30,Mary Morgan,,"It is about balance. A structural change such as that would need to come from a policy decision. Health boards are independent legal entities and there are all sorts of employment law that is wrapped around that, which means that there are boundaries in place. We work nationally—my evidence shows you all the national services that National Services Scotland offers. The health boards work regionally, and we have networks of services that operate regionally—when a board or hospital cannot provide a service locally, then it will be provided for them at another hospital. For example, the Golden Jubilee national hospital operates nationally and provides regional services to the west of Scotland. Further, many community services are provided locally.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:30,Mary Morgan,,"No matter what we do, whether we have a national organisation or not—we have a national organisation called the NHS in Scotland, although it is not the legal employer, if you like—we are always going to operate locally in communities and in places with other services in the way that has been discussed. Changes to structures will not take away the need to collaborate and to work together. NSS works with Transport Scotland on transport plans and how we can apply for funds for climate sustainability work, and so on. We need to collaborate and work together to provide solutions. Changing structures and organisational boundaries can be something of a distraction to the work that needs to be done.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:30,John Mason,,"As I understand it, someone in Ayrshire who may need a particular procedure that cannot be done locally would go to Glasgow. In a sense, that system is working at the moment, so there may not be a lot of space for reform. You have mentioned AI. I understood from your submission and other papers that there is a bit of a barrier to some things because different health boards are doing things differently.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:30,Mary Morgan,,"There will always be variation. Some of that will be warranted, because of employment circumstances or the demands of the local population, and some will be unwarranted, if it occurs simply because that is the way that particular things are done in a certain area. We have driven forward change through national procurement, for example, and in buying the same things from suppliers, so that procedures can become more similar. Some of those changes can take a long time to put in place, because, for example, it takes a long time to train consultants and nurses in particular procedures.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:30,Mary Morgan,,"The health system is not just about procedures and productivity around waiting times; it is about health and social care. As has been reported by the Auditor General and others, we need to get ourselves into a space of prevention—that is, preventing ill health in the first place. Just now, a lot of what we are looking at nationally is about how we move pathways of care to include prevention and what happens to people once they have had procedures. As a population, we need to move ourselves forward to the prevention agenda.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:30,The Convener,,"In my experience, we have gone backwards on flexibility in some respects. For example, a decade ago, some of my constituents in Skelmorlie, which is on the border of the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area, would have been able to go to Inverclyde hospital, but now they have to jump through all sorts of hoops to do that. Eighty-year-olds are having to visit relatives in hospital in Crosshouse, which, from their perspective, is at the far end of Ayrshire, when they have another hospital a few miles up the road.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:30,The Convener,,"There used to be a simple arrangement whereby people from Skelmorlie would have gone to Inverclyde hospital in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area and NHS Ayrshire and Arran would have paid for that, but I feel that there is now a reluctance to allow that to happen. The interests of the patients seem to be secondary to accountancy concerns. I am not convinced that the flexibility that you have mentioned has improved over the years. In my experience, we have gone slightly backwards in that regard.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt

Now, increasingly, an orthopaedic surgeon will do hands or shoulders or knees or hips.

11:30,Michael Marra,,"Is transparency not also a key issue in that regard? I have similar concerns to the convener. In NHS Tayside, no vasectomies have been carried out for two years. None were carried out for a whole year and then, using the kind of arrangements that you have described, we managed to secure 400 procedures—these were family planning decisions—to be carried out elsewhere. Those services have, in effect, been withdrawn locally but nobody has been told that. People are sitting on waiting lists and they need to be told about that situation. Is engagement with the public in the processes that you are talking about key to what you do?",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:30,Mary Morgan,,"Again, I cannot speak to what engagement looked like in particular circumstances, but Healthcare Improvement Scotland has set standards of engagement, which we all aspire to, in relation to changing or not delivering services. I do not know about the particular circumstances to which you refer; there might have been a prioritisation issue or there might have been a vacancy that meant that, for a particular period, there was no one available with the necessary skills to do that procedure.

However, that does not mean that we are not really trying to transform our organisation and our services. Public service reform has definitely provided opportunities for us. Off the top of my head, I can give the example that, traditionally, we would have looked to backfill a post such as head of digital or chief scientific adviser, but we have decided to co-fund those posts with similar bodies to split the costs. That also builds a relationship that was probably not there previously.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:30,Garry McEwan,,"We are tied into an accommodation contract in Aberdeen until 2029, but we have offered other public bodies and Scottish Government divisions the opportunity to co-locate in the accommodation at no additional cost. I am right in the middle of looking at how our finance department can support another public body that is far smaller than us and provide all its financial services. Earlier, I heard the Auditor General talk about the transformation of back-office and corporate functions, which is absolutely what we and other delivery bodies are trying to achieve.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:30,Garry McEwan,,"About two years ago, the delivery bodies group undertook an assessment of which corporate functions we could share as services. We were involved in a vast amount of work on that, and then public service reform came along, and, to be honest, that work did not quite wither on the vine but it stopped. It was only a couple of months ago that the chairs of the delivery bodies group reinstigated that work. We have done that because, as a delivery bodies cohort, we see the benefits and opportunities of shared services and the savings that can be made.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt

That was about creating a database and the opportunity to build in a licence fee for the 75,000 food businesses across the country. With limited investment in the next couple of years, up to about £6 million, year on year thereafter that could generate up to £30 million for the Scottish economy. Those are some of the ideas that we are trying to put to the Scottish Government and other places to generate income to meet those efficiencies.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt

As I said, it has been to and fro with our chief executive officer and our chair of the board for the past couple of years, but in the past two or three months, we got some limited funds for this year. We are not guaranteed the £3 million of funding for next year, but we are optimistic and hopeful that we will get that in the next two or three months.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:30,The Convener,,"You said that it has taken a couple of years.

Is that a concern?",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:30,Garry McEwan,,"The time that it has taken is certainly a frustration and a concern for us. I do not know whether there is a lack of urgency or whether the Scottish Government is involved in other priorities, with the result that the proposals from Food Standards Scotland and some of the other delivery bodies are not getting the same hearing. That is why I welcome the opportunity for a public service reform steering board or governance board. Once that is fully established and working as it is meant to work, we are hopeful that some of the proposals that we have made will get on to the table of the real decision makers.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt

11:30,Jane Morrison-Ross,,"To come back to Mr Marra’s question, we feel that we have agency to drive change and to focus on continuous innovation and evolution of what we need to do as an agency. We are aware that we are the newest enterprise agency. We are coming up to our fifth year, so we do not have decades of processes, bureaucracy and structure that we have to pull with us. We can be quite fleet of foot and flexible, and we can accelerate how we focus on what needs to be done for the south of Scotland, but we do that very much through a place-based lens.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:30,Jane Morrison-Ross,,"We are focused on what we are told to deliver by the Scottish Government. I have to say that we have excellent relationships with our sponsor team and the cabinet secretary, who are very transparent and open. However, we realised that that core ask of us was not enough for us to deliver what is needed and to catch up. We are very aware that Scottish Enterprise and HIE have been around for decades and we have not, and we have to play catch-up and run to deliver on what is needed.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:30,Jane Morrison-Ross,,"Therefore, we decided to look at the foundational blockers that we see in the south, which are very much the same in other areas—transport, skills and housing, which is absolutely critical for us. We also decided to focus on the core remit and the core deliverables of economic growth, SMEs, supporting businesses, enterprising communities and so on. We also considered the additional layer of where the opportunities are coming, which involved horizon scanning for what we could see that we would have to grab hold of very quickly.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:30,Jane Morrison-Ross,,"When I came into post, it was explained to me that the Scottish Government’s current and future inward investment focus for the south was food and drink. That was the only thing. Food and drink are incredibly important sectors for us in the south of Scotland and we are doing a lot of work there, but they are not the only important sectors. That is why we are now the natural capital innovation zone for Scotland, why we have a director of net zero and a head of energy transition, why we now have two hydrogen hotspots in the south of Scotland and why three quarters of our inward investment opportunities are focused on hydrogen and energy transition. That is because we went out and grabbed the opportunities that we could see. We were not neglecting the core remit; we were looking for a way to deliver on the ambition that we could hear from businesses and people across the south of Scotland.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:30,Ross Greer,,"I want to touch on the points about transparency that the convener made a moment ago. I would like to ask about availability of public data. Everybody here represents a public body.

11:30,Ross Greer,,"I do not want to continue picking on Transport Scotland, because I think that the issue relates partly to the Improvement Service as well, but I will give a small example. MSPs regularly lodge parliamentary questions to get updates on the number of young people who have been issued with concessionary bus passes. Usually, breakdowns by local authority are asked for. That seems to me to be a very unproductive system. There are similar areas in which we have to lodge freedom of information requests, for example. That data exists and the counter is constantly ticking up, but it is not on the front page of freebus.scot. That means that we have to go through a costly administrative process in Parliament—I presume that there is also a process in Transport Scotland and the Improvement Service—to get the data and present it. That is one small example.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:30,Ross Greer,,"Another example is that only a handful of public bodies in Scotland operate an open government licence.

Rather than having it behind a wall and then giving it to somebody when they come and ask for it, for example via FOI, what are you doing to pre-emptively and proactively make that data available in the first place?

In relation to the Scottish budget and the Scottish economy, it is vitally important that the proceeds of having highly skilled and highly paid jobs are shared throughout Scotland.

On the shift in population and population saturation by local authority area, East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian are clearly buckling under the pressure. What do we need to do at the national level to make sure that we can bring skilled jobs, firstly, to Scotland and, secondly, to areas like the south-west of Scotland, where there is clearly an issue in relation to young workers leaving the region?",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt

11:45,Chris Kerr,,"I will also respond to Mr Greer’s point about data. As you would imagine, Registers of Scotland holds a lot of data on land and property. I will mention two areas. We publish externally on the website as much as we can of the performance and productivity data that we hold internally, and we hold information and data in the registers, which are available and for which a fee is charged for access. There is a question about whether that is the right approach and whether some of the data in the registers should be available free of charge. That is ultimately a matter for ministers.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:45,Chris Kerr,,"There is an inherent cost to collecting and maintaining that data and keeping it safe, given what we know about cybersecurity and the risks to it, and that cost must fall somewhere.

11:45,Chris Kerr,,"We have not made as much progress as we perhaps wanted on including data from other organisations; there is a host of reasons for that. It is partly due to different licensing arrangements, and partly due to the fact that the various bodies that own or host the data have different rules around what they charge for it and whether they can make it freely available. There are also technical issues around making different elements of the data talk to each other, and making the system work from that point of view.

11:45,Chris Kerr,,"Absolutely. As I understand it, the key point is that Estonia’s system has excellent identification of individuals. It is absolutely reliable, with unique identifiers for individuals across sectors. That brings a lot of benefits.

11:45,Mary Morgan,,"I head Lynne Raeside talking about Microsoft; however, I point out that other vendors are available. Leading on a national procurement basis, we tend not to build but to buy off the shelf. There is a procurement process when it comes to building; the question in that respect is, “What is your specification?”, and it is important that the data parameters are built into the specification. An organisation can buy one system, but new systems are always developing, and it is important to understand the point about procurement rules and law in that respect.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:45,Mary Morgan,,"A real bugbear of mine is that I can buy a new games machine and plug it into my television at home, but in anything that we do we cannot buy a new digital system and just plug and play: interfaces need to be built and sorted through. One particular development in that respect is the national digital platform, which is being led by NHS Education for Scotland and is about building the various components of data and service pathways on a single platform, along with the interfaces. It will have multiple uses across the system, which is a really good thing.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt

11:45,Mary Morgan,,"Sometimes freedom of information requests come in. We regularly receive such requests. Sometimes we can answer them, because we own the data, but at other times we are simply processing data on behalf of others, so there can be a distinction in that regard. Nevertheless, we review every request that we get to see whether the information can be made more publicly available, instead of waiting for the next year’s request to come through, and we try to make things easier. There is learning that organisations can adopt, in that space.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:45,Mary Morgan,,"With regard to Mr Hoy’s point about the geography of jobs, one of the things that we have learned, gained and retained post Covid is the hybrid working that people have spoken about. We have reduced our building estate substantially. Because we are a national organisation that employs people nationally, we can have conversations with people about where they want to be located for their roles. For example, the more than 1,000 people whom we employed for the national contact tracing centre never had a base—they were home-based workers, and that is the basis on which we recruited, trained and deployed them. Indeed, we still employ a number of them on that basis. They are diversely employed across Scotland.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:45,Mary Morgan,,"It is interesting is that some of the really skilled people and skilled jobs are the middle managers, middle-level experts and up-and-coming people who have new ideas that they can bring to organisations. One of the biggest things that has assisted the diversity of geographical employment has been flexible working and hybrid working and its being accepted that people do not need to be in the office every day.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:45,Mary Morgan,,"With healthcare, though, there are constraints when it comes to particular skills. One would wish one’s obstetrician, for example, to be located so that they can get to the building where they deliver babies by a certain time. That sort of thing creates some constraint or restriction on where people might be located in relation to the hospitals for which they work.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:45,Mary Morgan,,"On the whole, though, I think that the approach has been really positive. A number of my senior team do not live in the central belt, in Edinburgh or in Glasgow, but live much further away and are still able to transact much of their business on a hybrid basis or, indeed, just from their homes. That has helped—location is less of a constraint than it used to be.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt

11:45,Jane Morrison-Ross,,"For me, there are probably three component parts to this, the first of which is awareness and recognition. As colleagues will recognise, I have made an absolute pain of myself at many levels of Government, reminding people frequently and regularly that the south of Scotland exists, so that I can ensure that we are taken into account when it comes to inward investment opportunities or developments.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:45,Jane Morrison-Ross,,"I was never a fan of the phrase “island proofing”, as a Millportonian—I always thought that it sounded like “child proofing”—but there is something to be said about the island-proofing approach being of benefit to rural economies, too. More could be done to take into account the opportunities for rural economies in decisions that are made at the national level, especially if they are inward-investment related.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
11:45,Jane Morrison-Ross,,"What we really need is a systems-based approach. One of the major challenges that we face in the south of Scotland—I know that this view is shared by HIE—is housing.

12:00,Jane Morrison-Ross,,"We have talked about the NHS. We worked very closely with NHS Dumfries and Galloway, which now has a massive shortage of suitable accommodation for workers whom it employs and for general practitioners and other specialists who are trying to come to the area. That also impacts on young people; we see that young people are leaving the region but, again, that will always happen. Young people often want to go off and train or take up jobs or education opportunities outside their region.

Glasgow School of Art is in discussion about what it could deliver there, and Heriot-Watt University and Napier University are involved in the Borders. There is increased choice for young people and increased access to courses, training, apprenticeships and graduate apprenticeships. Those will all help them to stay in the region or to come back to the region, but we also have to have the right jobs for them.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
12:00,Jane Morrison-Ross,,"I and many of my generation left Millport or Largs to study or take up jobs. If we wanted to go back home, we would not have been able to use our degrees. We want people to come back and to be able to use their degrees.

12:00,Lynne Raeside,,"That is a very good question, and I will come back to it. We fund APUC to carry out procurement on behalf of colleges and universities, which allows them an economy of scale when they are procuring products and services, rather than them individually buying those services. The savings are through economies of scale, but we can provide more information on that after the meeting.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
12:00,Garry McEwan,,"FSS has a data and digital steering board, and although I agree with Chris Kerr that the SG is not there to mandate, senior officials from the digital directorate sit on that group, and they absolutely make a huge contribution in advising me as the chair and others across the organisation on the best way forward, particularly on digital solutions. FSS is 10 years old, the infrastructure is old and dated and the systems are all outsourced. Over the next couple of years, we hope to inwardly invest in digital expertise so that we can build systems in-house, enhance cybersecurity and allow our information technology solutions to go on to the SG cloud, which they are not on currently.

12:00,The Convener,,"I have a question that I would like our guests to think about; they do not have to answer it. An issue that is debated back and forth in the public domain is that of where the £60 billion-plus budget should be spent. I imagine that all the organisations that are represented here would like to receive an increase in the funding that is available to them. Garry McEwan has been very direct about that, no doubt because of the 25.5 per cent real-terms cut that his organisation has endured over the past decade.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
12:00,The Convener,,"If you would like your organisation to receive an increase in funding, could you say how much additional funding it would be appropriate for it to receive for the forthcoming financial year? In addition—this is the $64 million question, which you may or may not want to answer—if it is your position that your organisation needs extra money, please say where that money should come from. Have you identified where in the Scottish budget it should come from? Alternatively, should it come from additional taxation? I do not want everyone simply to say, “Aye, just give us more money.” That will not help us in any way, because we still have the same budget. If anyone has anything to say about where they think that money could be redirected from, I would be happy to hear from them. Do not all rush at once.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt

12:00,Mary Morgan,,"We would always like to have more money. It is important that the costs of initiatives are covered. Someone mentioned the reduction in the working week. We are going through that process in health at the moment. It involves significant additional costs. Although we can absorb that in areas where we do not use shift workers, there are additional costs in areas where we have shifts to cover on a 24/7 basis and where the staff member is inseparable from the patient or donor.

12:00,Mary Morgan,,"We would always like to have more money and to have our costs covered in the first instance, but my personal view is that I would like to eliminate my organisation’s reliance on non-recurrent funding for individual projects and programmes.

12:00,Lynne Raeside,,"It also depends on the minister’s decision on the consultation about the future of the funding body landscape.

It will be rhetorical—we are not going to debate it—so it is just any point that you want to make.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt

12:00,Garry McEwan,,"I will very quickly make a point on shared services and delivery bodies. I genuinely feel that if delivery bodies were to have a bit of headspace over the short term—18 months to two years—with a ring-fenced resource, they could collectively make some real efficiencies around shared service provision and back-office and corporate support functions, but they need a bit of breathing space, as a cohort, to enable them to do that.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt

12:00,Chris Kerr,,"We have worked on that very hard with our Scottish Government finance colleagues and we have been able to reduce our request for capital spending in the budget for the year that we are talking about down to £700,000. That is down from what would usually be around £3 million to £4 million, depending on the capital expenditure that is needed each year. That is a good thing and we hope to continue that approach as we go forward, but there is a lot of complexity in the public finance rules, which sometimes hinder opportunities to be innovative.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt

12:15,The Convener,,Another idea is that you should get to keep the savings that you make in your portfolio. I worked in the private sector—I will not say who for.

12:15,The Convener,,Indeed. I think that the committee would agree with more or less all of that.,2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
12:15,Lynne Raeside,,"Gosh. That is an interesting question to end with. I have a similar point to the one that Mary Morgan made about learning lessons from elsewhere. In education reform, there are lessons to be learned from England and Wales, with the creation of the Office for Students and the Medr. It is really important that we learn the lessons from other educational reforms in other parts of the UK.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
12:15,Lynne Raeside,,"One of the biggest lessons is that we must take the time to ensure that there are no unintended consequences. We also need to take along with us the expertise from within the organisations that are being reformed. There is a lot of expertise in them, and we must not lose that expertise as we go through the reform process.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
12:15,The Convener,,"I agree, except that we should sometimes look beyond the UK, because there are ideas across the world that we can learn from.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
12:15,Lynne Raeside,,Indeed.,2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
12:15,The Convener,,"Last, and certainly not least, I will bring in Jane Morrison-Ross.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
12:15,Jane Morrison-Ross,,"PSR gives us a huge opportunity. The world has changed dramatically and will continue to change dramatically. Therefore, what we do as a whole public sector has to change dramatically to deliver against that.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
12:15,Jane Morrison-Ross,,"I worry a little bit about the focus on shared services. As a former consultant, I know that that approach will cost a lot of money and might not deliver the savings that are needed. As Mary Morgan said, technology is the easy bit and the changes to culture, people and the process are much harder. One size does not fit all.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
12:15,Jane Morrison-Ross,,"Again, that takes me back to the south of Scotland. We are very keen to see a national approach to PSR. We need to take the opportunities to evolve while allowing for a place-based lens to translate whatever is decided into something that will work for the regions that we serve.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
12:15,The Convener,,I thank all our witnesses for their participation today and for their written contributions.,2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
12:15,The Convener,,"We will continue our evidence taking on the Scottish budget 2025-26 next week, when we will hear from the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body on its budget bid and from the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Local Government.",2025-01-07,scottish_parliament_report_07_01_25.txt
